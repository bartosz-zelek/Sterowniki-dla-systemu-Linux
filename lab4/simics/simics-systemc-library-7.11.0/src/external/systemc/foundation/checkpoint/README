SystemC Foundation Libraries - Checkpoint support
==================================================
This folder contains the following sub-folders:
- accellera-lt-chkpt
  A ported version of the accellera-lt example device. Used with the
  examples.patch patch applied to the examples shipped alongside the kernel
- manual
  The checkpoint library documentation.
- manual-device
  The documentation control device. This device is compiled and linked
  as part of the build to make sure that regressions are not introduced
  to the documentation.
- serialization
  A forked boost::serialization library that allows us to a) not collide with
  other uses of boost:serialization and b) fix bugs and add features in
  isolation
- systemc-checkpoint
  The SystemC checkpoint support library. It depends on the forked
  serialization module and a patched SystemC kernel, like the Intel SystemC
  Kernel.

Instructions for building the library and documentation
=======================================================
The checkpoint library is self-contained with libs, documentation, an example
device and a Makefile to build it. These are the steps required to build the
library:
1. Select a GCC compiler. The library is tested with GCC 4.9.2.
2. Select a SystemC Kernel. The library is tested with 2.3.1.
3. Download and install Boost 1.65.1. This particular version is *required*
   because cci::serialization is a fork of boost::serialization which
   expects the same version of the rest of Boost.
4. Apply the corresponding patch to your SystemC Kernel and optionally
   the SystemC examples.
5. Build and install the patched SystemC Kernel
6. Modify the Makefile to set:
   BOOST_INC_DIR:= <path to where you installed Boost headers>
   BOOST_LIB_DIR:= <path to where you installed Boost libraries>
   KERNEL_DIR:= <path to the source of the patch SystemC kernel>
   KERNEL_LIB:= <path to the patched libsystemc.a>
   CXX:= <path to the compiler used to compile Boost and SystemC>
   You may also need to update AR, MAKE, PDFLATEX and PYTHON variables to match
   your system.
7. Run make
8. There should now be a doc/systemc-checkpoint.pdf with detailed information
   about how to use the Checkpoint library.

Instructions for building and running the accellera-lt example
==============================================================
Additionally, the library is complemented with a patch and additional
source files needed to port the accellera-lt device of the SystemC
kernel example suite. These are the steps required to build and run
the device:
1. Perform steps 1-6 in the Instructions for building the library and
   documentation. Be sure to apply the examples.patch patch to the
   examples shipped alongside the SystemC kernel.
2. Run make, optionally specifying the target "accellera-lt".
3. Run the "accellera-lt" binary, which should have been produced
   under the "obj" directory. The program accepts one of the following
   arguments:
     0 - Instantiate device and run for 1000 PS
     1 - Instantiate device, run for 500 PS, and save a checkpoint
     2 - Instantiate device, load the checkpoint, and run for 500 PS
