<h1 id="debugger-limitations"><a href="#debugger-limitations">3.4 Debugger Limitations</a></h1>
<p>This section lists limitations for the Simics debugger in the current release of Simics.</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>32-bit x86 that uses segmentation will not work properly with the debugger as it works with linear addresses.</li>
<li>Xtensa register windows are not handled by the debugger.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux Tracker</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Linux trackers only allow access to the currently active software node on each processor core. Therefore it is not possible to access the memory of inactive tasks.</li>
<li>The Linux tracker does not automatically detect the load addresses of dynamically loaded software. You have to enter this information manually.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Breakpoints</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot plant a watchpoint on a local variable.</li>
<li>When planting an expression breakpoint, the expression will be evaluated when the breakpoint is hit. If the expression is not valid, no error will be reported and the target will stop as if the expression was evaluated successfully.</li>
</ul>
