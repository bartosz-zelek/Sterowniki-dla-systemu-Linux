  There are several possible debug targets in a Windows set up. To cover them
  all, open an elevated command prompt window on the target system, and enter
  the following commands:
</p><p>
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">&gt; <b>BCDEDIT /SET '{BOOTMGR}' BOOTDEBUG ON</b>
&gt; <b>BCDEDIT /SET BOOTDEBUG ON</b>
&gt; <b>BCDEDIT /SET DEBUG ON</b>
  </pre><p>
</p><p>
  </p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
When boot debug is enabled, Windows will wait for a while during the boot
    to see if a WinDbg is connecting, and then proceed with the boot. Thus,
    enabling boot debug will make the boot take a little longer (a few
    virtual minutes of wait time).
