<p>When users write and build Simics modules the compiled modules end up in the userâ€™s project. One of the most reliable ways to distribute a set of files across many users is to create a Customer Package.</p>
<p>Once installed a Customer Package is a Simics Package just like any other Simics Package. All technical differences between Customer Packages and usual packages are only relevant before the Customer Package is installed.</p>
<p>The key differences are that an uninstalled Customer Package is a simple <code>.zip</code> or <code>.tar.gz</code> file while a usual package is an encrypted archive with an installer.</p>
<p>To install a Customer Package simply untar or unzip and then use the <code>bin/addon-manager[.bat]</code> to register the package. The chapter "Advanced Installation Options" in the <em>Installation Guide</em> describes how to use the <code>addon-manager</code> program.</p>
<p>On Linux, Customer Package can also be encrypted to <code>.aes</code> file which can be installed directly with the Simics installer.</p>
