<p>
Combine mappings in the report that have the same symbol file, but are located at different addresses.
</p><p>
When combining two or more mappings the combined mapping will get the addresses of the mapping that has most covered instructions. If two or more mappings have the same amount of covered instructions the first mapping (from the 'mappings' list in the raw format) will be used for addresses of the combined mapping.
