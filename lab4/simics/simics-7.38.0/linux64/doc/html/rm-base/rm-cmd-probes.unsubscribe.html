 Probes which have already been subscribed to, using the <code>&lt;probes&gt;.subscribe</code> command, can with this command be unsubscribed to. If there are zero users on the subscribed probe, some features can be turned off, potentially reducing run-time overhead.
<p>
Without any arguments, all probes which have been earlier subscribed too will be unsubscribed. To more precisely select the probes that should be unsubscribed to, there are a number of filters to reduce the scope.
</p><p>
The <i>probe-kind</i> filter specifies which probe-kinds to include. This can be the full name of a specific probe kind, or the string can be a partial kind, for example specifying <tt>cpu.exec_modes.</tt> would include all probe-kinds starting with this string.
</p><p>
The <i>substr</i> argument filter allows only probes which has a specific string in the probe name to be displayed.
</p><p>
To find probes in a particular object the <i>object</i> argument can be used, only showing the probes on that specific object.
</p><p>
In combination with the <i>object</i> argument the <tt>-recursive</tt> switch can be used to look at the probes that exists beneath the specified object, in the object hierarchy. This allows zooming in on the probes within a particular subsystem of the entire target system.
</p><p>
Each probe might be assigned with a number of categories represented as strings that describe some property of what they measure. The <i>categories</i> filter can be used to only include the probes which have <b>all</b> of the requested categories included.
</p><p>
Probes can returned different types when read. The <i>probe-types</i> argument allows only certain types to be shown.
