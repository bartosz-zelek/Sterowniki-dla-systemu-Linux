</h2>
 Run the simulation until the processor has executed <i>cycle</i> number of cycles. If <tt>-absolute</tt> is specified, the simulation will instead run until the processor reaches the specified cycle in the simulation.
<p>
If no processor is specified, the currently selected frontend processor is used. If <i>timeout</i> is a positive number, the command will run for at most that many seconds of virtual time.
</p><p>
If <i>timeout-rt</i> is a positive number, the command will run for at most that many seconds of real time.
</p><p>
A time-out will be signaled by throwing a CLI exception, which can be captured using try/except in order to take specific action, or to let it pass unhandled.
</p><p>
If <i>object</i> is provided, then the breakpoint functionality is added on that object.
