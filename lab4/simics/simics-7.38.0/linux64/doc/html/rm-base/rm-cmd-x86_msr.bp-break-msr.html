</h2>
 Enables breaking simulation on MSR architectural updates.
<p>
The <i>name</i> or <i>number</i> parameter specifies which MSR is considered. The available MSRs depend on the simulated target. Only MSRs implemented in CPU model are supported. MSRs are supported by x86 CPUs starting from PentiumÂ®. If the <tt>-all</tt> flag is specified, all MSRs are considered. Usage of -all could degrade performance.
</p><p>
If <tt>-r</tt> is specified, only MSR read accesses are considered. If <tt>-w</tt> is specified, only MSR write accesses are considered. The default is to consider both reads and writes.
</p><p>
If <tt>-only-changes</tt> is specified, only write accesses that change the MSR value are considered. In this case, if <i>mask</i> is specified, only changes affecting this mask of the MSR are considered.
</p><p>
If <i>value</i> is specified, only write accesses that results in the MSR having this value are considered, or read accesses when the MSR has this value. If <i>mask</i> is specified, only this mask of the MSR and given value are considered.
</p><p>
If no processor object is specified, the currently selected processor is used.
</p><p>
The <tt>-once</tt> flag causes the breakpoint to automatically be removed after it has triggered.
