<dt class="jdocu_descitem">Description</dt><dd class="jdocu_descitem">This interface is implemented by the Xtensa core which holds the
   configuration of the Windowed Watchdog Timer. The device itself is not part
   of the core, but implemented as an external device which fetches these
   values for correct device simulation, making the wwdt device generic
   for all configurations.
<p>
   The <code>has_wwdt</code> method reports if the wwdt option is included in the
   core at all. The rest of the member functions extract configuration details
   from the core, if the core does not have wwdt enabled, all are zeros.
