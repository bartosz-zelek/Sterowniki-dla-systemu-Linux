can be connected to processors which support instrumentation.
This tool can be used to get an instruction histogram based of the frequency
of the instructions that have been executed.

The <arg>view</arg> argument decides which
instruction "perspective" that should be collected.
Currently there are four choices:
<br/>1. <b>mnemonic</b> - Groups all instructions with
the same first word in the instruction disassembly.
<br/>2. <b>size</b> - Groups the instructions by the length of the
instruction.
<br/>3. <b>xed-iform</b> - Uses Intel® X86 Encoder Decoder (Intel® XED)
module and groups the x86 instruction by their instruction form definition.
<br/>4. <b>x86-normalized</b> - The instruction disassembly, but
replaces register names and immediates with normalized names.
<br/>Default, the <i>mnemonic</i> view is used.
The <i>xed-iform</i> and <i>x86-normalized</i> views are only
applicable when connected to x86 target processors."""
