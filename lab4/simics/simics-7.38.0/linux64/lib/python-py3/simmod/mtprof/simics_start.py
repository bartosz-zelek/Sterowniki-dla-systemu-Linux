Enable multithreaded simulation profiling. The amount of
host cpu time required to simulate each cell is measured
every <arg>interval</arg> virtual ms.

The collected data is fed into a performance model which
estimates how fast the simulation would run on a system
with enough host cores and Simics Accelerator licenses to
allow each cell to run on a dedicated core. The performance
model also gives some insights into the performance implications
of various min-latency settings (settable though the
<cmd>set-min-latency</cmd> commands).

The <arg>interval</arg> parameter should normally be set to a value
of the same order as the min-latency setting of interest.""")
