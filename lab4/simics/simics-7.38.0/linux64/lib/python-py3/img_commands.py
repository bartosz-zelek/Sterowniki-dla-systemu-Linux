If file are overlapping, the contents of the last file in the list takes
precedence. Note that certain file formats support holes.

Limits the in-memory footprint of all image objects to <arg>limit</arg>

While this is typically a very large part of Simics's memory usage, other
data structures are not limited by this command.

If <arg>limit</arg> is zero, the memory limit is removed.
If <arg>swapdir</arg> is specified, it indicates a directory to use for
swap files. If no argument is given, the current setting is

Simics sets a default memory limit at startup that depends on the amount of
memory on the host system, generally about two-thirds.
