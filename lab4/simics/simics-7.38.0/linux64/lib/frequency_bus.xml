<device name="frequency_bus" desc="frequency bus" documentation="The &lt;class&gt;frequency_bus&lt;/class&gt; class implements a bus that distributes a frequency to a set of targets. Targets subscribe to the bus via the &lt;iface&gt;simple_dispatcher&lt;/iface&gt; interface, and frequency changes are distributed to subscribers via the &lt;iface&gt;frequency_listener&lt;/iface&gt; iface. The distributed frequency can either be generated by the bus itself, or be fetched from a different object (e.g., from another frequency bus). The input frequency can optionally be scaled before it is distributed." bitorder="le">
