Compiling SimicsFS client
-------------------------

SimicsFS client depends on the following parts:

  - FUSE (kernel module and library)
  - Simics Magic Pipe library (libmagicpipe)

FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is a Linux package installed by the used Linux
distribution.

Simics Magic Pipe library needs to be compiled to generate the library
libmagicpipe.a.

When compiling SimicsFS client the following is needed:

  - Include path to Magic Pipe library header files
  - Magic Pipe library libmagicpipe.a
  - Include path to FUSE header files
  - FUSE libraries


Statically linked SimicsFS client
---------------------------------

While not recommended, SimicsFS can be statically linked using the -static
flag, but be aware that it will generate a linker warning:

   fuse.c:165: warning: Using 'dlopen' in statically linked applications
   requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for
   linking

The warning is very important. Any differences in the statically linked
libraries (or their dependencies) between the compile environment and the
target run-time environment will lead to undefined behaviour, which may cause
crashes or other side-effects. Therefore whenever the target system is updated
the client must also be rebuilt against the exact same library versions.

When linking statically the following libraries must also be specified in the
Makefile:

  - pthreads library (-lpthread)
  - dynamic loader library (-ldl)

Library paths to static libraries may also have to be added in the Makefile.


SimicsFS client options
-----------------------

SimicsFS client has a lot of FUSE options, use the following command to see
them all:

  # simicsfs-client -h

See also FUSE manual with the following command:

  # man fuse
  

Debugging SimicsFS client
-------------------------

SimicsFS client may be started with an optional debug flag (-d) that prints
debugging information in the window foreground:

  # ./simicsfs-client -d <dir> -omodules=subdir,subdir=/home/<user>

Then use another window to enter file system commands on the mounted file
system.

It can also be useful to turn on log messages from either SimicsFS server or
Magic Pipe, in the Simics CLI:

  simics> simicsfs_server.log-level 4
  simics> magic_pipe.log-level 4
