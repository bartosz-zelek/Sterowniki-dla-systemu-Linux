 *    specify the number of registers between a pair of square brackets,
 *    e.g., r[8]. By default the stride of the array is the size of the
 *    register, but other values can be chosen as follows, r[8 stride 4].

 * 3. An address offset of the register relative to its enclosing bank
 * 4. An nonzero number of 8-bit bytes of the register
 * 5. An initial value of the register
 * 6. Optional fields information. An empty vector means no fields for
 *    the register.
