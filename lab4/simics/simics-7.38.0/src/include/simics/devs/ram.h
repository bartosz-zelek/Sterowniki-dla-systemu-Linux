     The <iface>ram</iface> interface is implemented by classes that provide
     random access read/write memory. The <iface>rom</iface> interface is
     identical to <iface>ram</iface> but provides read only memory (writes are
     dropped by the memory system).

     Both the ram and rom interfaces are Simics internal, and should not be used
     by user-defined classes.

     The <fun>get_page</fun> method is obsolete and should not be implemented.

     The <fun>fill</fun> method fills a range with a specified byte value.

     The <fun>read</fun> method reads a number of bytes from address
     <param>addr</param> into the buffer <param>data</param>. The number of
     bytes read is given by the buffer size.

     The <fun>write</fun> method writes the bytes in <param>data</param> to
     address <param>addr</param>.

     The <fun>touch</fun> method is similar to the <fun>read</fun> and
     <fun>write</fun> methods, except that no data is actually transferred; the
     method triggers side effects like revoking conflicting direct-memory
     permissions from affected pages. The <param>rw</param> argument determines
     whether the operation is a handled as a read or as a write.

     The <param>flags</param> argument is a bitmask which modify the behavior
     of <fun>read</fun>, <fun>write</fun> and <fun>touch</fun> operations in
     various ways.

     The <fun>size</fun> method returns the memory size in bytes; that is, the
     highest usable address plus one.
