/* <add id="instrumentation_tool_interface_t">

   This interface is intended to be implemented by instrumentation tools using
   the instrumentation framework. The instrumentation framework handles setting
   up, controlling and removing the connection between providers and tools, but
   the actual communication is handled by instrumentation specific interfaces.

   When a connection with a provider is being established, the
   <fun>connect</fun> method is called. The <arg>provider</arg> argument
   specifies the provider which should be connected. The <arg>args</arg>
   are tool specific arguments that can be used allowing the connection
   to be configured a certain way. The tool should create a new
   dedicated connection object, which register itself with the provider
   using the dedicated interface. The connection object created
   is returned by the <fun>connect</fun> function.   
   If, for any reason, the tool cannot successfully connect
   to the provider, NULL should be returned to indicate failure.

   If a connection should be removed, the <fun>disconnect</fun> method
   is called. The <arg>conn_obj</arg> argument is the connection object
   returned earlier in <fun>connect</fun>.
   It is up to the tool to delete the created object which should
   unregister itself from the provider.

   This interface is intended to be implemented by instrumentation connections
   using the instrumentation framework. This interface is used to request that
   instrumentation should be temporarily disabled and then re-enabled. That is,
   the connection should not collect any data when it is being disabled. How
   this is achieved is up to the tool, it could tell the provider to stop
   sending information, or simply throw away anything it sends.
   This interface can be used with high frequency while simulation is running,
   so it should be implemented with performance in mind.
