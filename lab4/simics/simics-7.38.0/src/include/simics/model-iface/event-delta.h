   The <iface>event_handler</iface> interface is implemented by
   the <tt>vtime</tt> port object and is invoked by clocks or CPUs
   implementing the <iface>event_delta</iface> interface.

   The <fun>handle_event</fun> method should be called when the number
   of cycles to the next event has reached zero. The method
   invokes the next event and notifies the CPU or clock about the cycle count
   to the next pending event by invoking the <fun>set_delta</fun> method.

   The <fun>stop</fun> method should be called if a dispatched
   event requests the simulation to be stopped. The method is typically
   called from the <fun>stop</fun> method of the <iface>execute</iface>
   interface. If the <fun>stop</fun> method is not called, then time may be
   advanced by a fraction of a cycle after an event has been dispatched.
