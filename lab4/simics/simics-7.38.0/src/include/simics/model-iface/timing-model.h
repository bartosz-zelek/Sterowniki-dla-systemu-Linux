/* <add id="timing_model_interface_t">
   The <iface>timing_model</iface> interface is used to communicate
   stall times for memory accesses. It is typically exported by cache
   models. The <fun>operate()</fun> function is then called on every
   memory access that misses in the STC, and the return value from the
   call is the number of cycles to stall.

   The <iface>snoop_memory</iface> interface has the exact same layout
   as the <iface>timing_model</iface> interface, but its
   <fun>operate()</fun> function is called after the memory access has
   been performed. The return value from the <fun>operate()</fun>
   function of a <iface>snoop_memory</iface> interface is ignored.

   The <fun>operate</fun> function is invoked via the <attr>timing_model</attr>
   attribute of the <class>memory-space</class> where the STC miss happens.

   See the <cite>Model Builder User's Guide</cite> for more information on
   how to use these interfaces.
