  <add id="exec_trace_interface_t">

  The <iface>exec_trace</iface> interface is implemented by processor models
  that support tracing. A trace listener registers itself with the
  <fun>register_tracer</fun> call. The <arg>tracer</arg> callback will be
  called by the processor model
  when each instruction is just about to be executed, passing the
  <arg>tracer_data</arg> as passed to the <fun>register_tracer</fun> function
  in addition to information about the instruction that is executed.
  Invoke <fun>unregister_tracer</fun> with the same two pointers to deregister
  the listener.

  <insert id="instruction_trace_callback_t def"/>

  The <arg>pa</arg> parameter to the callback will always be valid, but some
  CPU architectures may not support <arg>la</arg> or <arg>va</arg>. The
  <arg>la</arg> argument is typically only valid for x86 CPUs. Lastly, the
  opcode of the instruction is passed in <arg>opcode</arg>. The
  <arg>opcode</arg> is passed without endian conversion, meaning that byte X in
  <arg>opcode</arg> corresponds to the byte at <arg>pa</arg> + X.
