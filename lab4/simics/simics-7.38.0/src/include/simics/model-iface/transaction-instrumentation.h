   Note: This callback is internal and may change without notice.

   Instrumentation callback function registered through the
   <fun>register_issue_cb</fun>
   method in the <iface>transaction_subscribe</iface> interface. In this
   callback a user can snoop and/or replace a transaction passing through a
   map target object.

   Argument <param>obj</param> is the object that registered the callback.  The
   <param>mt</param> argument is the map target used to map the transaction,
   and the <param>map_target_type</param> is a string describing the map
   target.  The <param>map</param> parameter is map information for the map
   target.  <param>addr</param> is the address in the mapped object where the
   transaction hits. You can retrieve the object by calling
   <fun>SIM_map_target_object</fun> on the map_target.  The <param>t</param>
   argument is a pointer to the transaction that is issued. See the access
   primitives of the <type>transaction_t</type> type to see how to examine and
   modify the transaction. The <param>do_mt</param> is the function to call
   that actually do the map target access, and it is the callback's
   responsibility to call it. This allows the map target, the map, the address,
   and the transaction to be modified by then callback. Se the documentation of
   the <type>do_mt</type> for a description of how to call it.

   The callback should return a <type>next_map_t</type> value that is the
   return value of the do_mt callback. This describes the next map target to be
   considered, if the map target translates to a new map target. In this case,
   the next target is stored in the <var>mt</var> field. If no new map target is
   used, the field will be NULL. The type also contains an <var>ex</var> field
   set to something else than Sim_PE_No_Exception, if an exception occurred. It
   also has a <var>addr</var> field which describes the new address for the next
   map target.

   If the do_mt function is not called, this effectively cancels the
   transaction.  The value map_next_t to return should then fill in the mt
   field with a NULL pointer.

   Note: this interface is internal and may change without notice.

   This interface is used to register callbacks to instrument transactions
   issued through a map target by the SIM_issue_transaction API call. This
   includes all <class>memory_space</class> objects handling transactions.
   The interface is only implemented by the <obj>sim.transactions</obj>
   object which serves all transactions.

   The <fun>register_issue_cb</fun> method registers a callback that is
   called whan a transaction is passed to a map target. This makes it
   possible to modify or replace the transaction before it reaches its
   destination. See the documentation of the
   <type>transaction_issue_cb_t</type> type for more information on now to
   handle the transaction.

   A <type>transaction_cb_handle_t</type> pointer is returned as a reference to
   the callback.

   The registered callbacks above will receive all types of accesses,
   read, write, or execute, from any initiator hitting any address range. It is
   up to the callback to filter the information if needed, e.g., to only trace
   read accesses.

   If more than one cell is used and multithreading is enabled, more that one
   callback can be issued at the same time.

   Normally, for transactions to ram/rom, these accesses can be bypassed by
   caching the destination object by using the
   <iface>direct_memory_lookup</iface> interface. Then these accesses cannot be
   monitored by the <iface>transaction_subscribe</iface> interface. However, it
   is possible to block this caching by using the
   <fun>register_access_filter_cb</fun> method of the
   <iface>ram_access_subscribe</iface> interface. This has typically severe
   impact on simulation speed, but allows user to monitor all transactions in
   the system. Note however that a real systems also reduces the transactions to
   memory by using caches, which normally is not modeled by
   Simics,

   The <fun>remove_callback</fun> method removes an earlier installed
   callback. The handle is used to identify the callback to be removed. The
   register functions above return such handle.

   The <fun>enable_callback</fun> and <fun>disable_callback</fun> methods
   temporarily enables and disables a previously installed callback. Note that
   this will not necessary speed up the simulation, since the caching may be
   blocked anyway. The handle is used to identify the callback. The register
   functions above return such handle.
