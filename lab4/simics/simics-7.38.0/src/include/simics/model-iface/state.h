/* SIMICS-17129 - this is really a model-model interface, not model-simulator */

/* <add id="uint64_state_interface_t">

   Interface to transfer a state representable in an uint64 from one device to
   another.  Examples of what the state might represent includes:

   <dl>
     <li>a fixed-point value representing the level of an analog signal</li>
     <li>an integer representing a counter</li>
     <li>an integer representing an enum value</li>
   </dl>

   The initiator should call <fun>set</fun> when the value changes, and after a
   new target is connected.  The object implementing
   <iface>uint64_state</iface> should accept multiple calls to <fun>set</fun>
   with the same level, and may let this trigger side-effects. Therefore, any
   repeated calls must be deterministic; in particular, <fun>set</fun> must not
   be called while restoring a checkpoint.

   A device implementing this interface may choose to only accept a certain set
   of integer values; it is then an error to send any other values to the
   <fun>set</fun> method.  A user must therefore be careful to read the
   documentation of both the source and destination object to make sure they
   are compatible.

   No interface call needs to be done after disconnecting a target; the target
   needs to be notified of this through some other channel (typically via a
   connector)

   <note>The <iface>uint64_state</iface> interface should be used instead of
   the deprecated <iface>multi_level_signal</iface> interface when writing new
   models.</note>
