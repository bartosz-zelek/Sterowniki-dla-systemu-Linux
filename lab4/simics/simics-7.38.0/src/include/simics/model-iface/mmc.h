/* <add id="mmc_interface_t">
   <insert-until text="// ADD INTERFACE mmc_interface"/>

   Interface that should be implemented by all MMC/SD/SDHC/SDIO card models.

   send_command: sends a 5-byte command to the card (1-byte command index and
                 4 bytes command arguments).
                 Caller provides the response length. Card fills in actual
                 response data. The response data is 0, 6 or 17 bytes,
                 in big-endian (see the MMC/SD specification for details).
                 Return value: number of response bytes, -1 if the command
                 wasn't accepted (e.g. command is not supported or illegal in
                 current state, or command is not supported or illegal for
                 current card type).

   read_data: reads data. Caller provides the length.
              Return value: the card fills in the provided buffer, and returns
              the number of bytes actually read, which might be less than the
              buffer length in case of error.

   write_data: writes data. Caller provides in both length and data.
               Return value: number of bytes actually written, which might be
               less than the provided data length in case of error.
