   The breakpoint interface is implemented by any object that supports breaking
   on an address range.

   <insert-until text="// ADD INTERFACE breakpoint_interface"/>

   The <fun>insert_breakpoint</fun> function is called when adding a
   breakpoint on <arg>object</arg>. The <arg>handle</arg> identified the
   breakpoint and is to be used when triggering the breakpoint and when
   breakpoints are removed. The <arg>access</arg> parameter specifies the types
   of accesses that the breakpoint is set for. The breakpoint range is from
   <arg>start</arg> to <arg>end</arg> and includes both ends.

   The implementer of this interface should call <arg>caller</arg> through the
   <iface>breakpoint_trigger</iface> interface to trigger the breakpoint.

   <b>remove_breakpoint</b> should remove the breakpoint and further accesses
   to the address range should not trigger that breakpoint.

   This interface is only to be used by the Simics core. Other uses of
   breakpoints should go through the available breakpoint API calls such as
   <fun>SIM_breakpoint</fun>.

   Objects implementing the <iface>breakpoint</iface> interface
   typically also implement the <iface>breakpoint_trigger</iface>
   interface. Processors call the <fun>trigger_breakpoint</fun>
   function to signal that a memory access intersects a
   breakpoint. The <fun>trigger_breakpoint</fun> function will raise
   the appropriate haps and the currently scheduled execute object may
   receive a <fun>stop</fun> call during the call to
   <fun>trigger_breakpoint</fun>.

   The <arg>obj</arg> argument is the object that holds the
   breakpoint, typically a memory space or a context
   object. <arg>initiator_obj</arg> is the source of the memory
   operation that triggers the breakpoint. The <arg>handle</arg>
   argument identifies the breakpoint to trigger. A value of
   <arg>BREAKPOINT_HANDLE_ANY</arg> can be passed as
   <arg>handle</arg>, in which case all the breakpoints that match the
   given <arg>address</arg>, <arg>size</arg>, and <arg>access</arg>
   will be triggered. The <arg>address</arg>, <arg>size</arg>, and
   <arg>access</arg> arguments specify information about the access
   that triggers the breakpoint. The <arg>data</arg> argument points
   to a buffer where the data for the access is kept.

   If a <fun>stop</fun> is received during a call to
   <fun>trigger_breakpoint</fun>, then it is recommended that any
   software visible actions carried out after the breakpoint are
   logged. That could for example be to notify the user if the entire
   instruction that triggers a breakpoint will complete, and that the
   instruction will then not be re-executed when the simulation
   restarts.

     The callback is called before the read or write has taken place, but may

     the current instruction is completed before the stop takes effect. If more

     Add and remove virtual-address (and, on x86, linear-address) instruction
     breakpoints. Every time the processor executes an instruction that
     intersects the breakpoint's interval, the callback function is called with
     the processor, and the address and size of the instruction. (The interval
     includes both endpoints; <param>first</param> must be less than or equal
     to <param>last</param>.)

     The callback is called before the instruction is executed. If one or more
     breakpoint callbacks stop the simulation, the stop takes effect before
     the instruction is run. (This means that once the simulation starts
     again, the same breakpoints will trigger immediately again. The callback
     can use <fun>VT_step_stamp</fun> to detect re-triggering.) If more than
     one breakpoint is triggered by the same instruction, the implementation
     may call their callbacks in any order.

     If the filter function is non-null and returns false, the callback is not
     called. The filter function is supplied with the instruction opcode (the
     raw bytes of the instruction) and a processor (which may not be the same
     processor that the breakpoint is set on, but is guaranteed to be of the
     same class). The filter may base its decision only on the opcode bytes and
     the string obtained by asking the processor to disassemble the
     instruction; this allows the implementation to cache the result and omit
     future calls to the filter function where the opcode and disassembly
     string would be the same.

     On x86, the <tt>Virtual_Breakpoint_Flag_Linear</tt> flag causes the
