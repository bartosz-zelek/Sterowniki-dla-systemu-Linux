/* <add id="keyboard_interface_t">

   Interface implemented by keyboard controllers. Used by consoles to send
   keyboard events to the controller.

   The function <fun>keyboard_event()</fun> takes the keyboard controller as
   its first argument <arg>obj</arg>. The <arg>key_up</arg> argument specifies
   whether the event is a key release (1) or a key press (0). The
   <arg>key</arg> argument is the Simics internal keycode, as defined in
   the <type>sim_key_t</type> enum.

   If the return value is 1 the keyboard controller accepted the event. If
   return value is 0 the keyboard controller did not accept the event, and the
   console should buffer the event until it gets a <fun>keyboard_ready()</fun>
   call from the keyboard controller.

   Interface implemented by consoles, to receive notifications from keyboard

   when it is ready to receive keyboard events again after having rejected a
   keyboard event. Note that this function may be called even though no
   keyboard event has been rejected, and that the console must not assume that
   keyboard controller will accept an event just because the
   <fun>keyboard_ready()</fun> function has been called.
