   <add id="int_register_interface_t"> The <iface>int_register</iface>
   interface is used for access to registers in a processor.  It
   can be used to access any kind of integer register, not only the
   "normal" registers.  This includes all kinds of control registers,
   hidden registers and anything else that might be useful to access as
   a register.  The only limitation is that the register value should
   be representable as a 64-bit unsigned integer.

   This interface can be implemented by other classes than processors,
   but it is likely to be found mostly in processors.
 
   Registers are identified by a number, and there are two functions
   to translate from register names to register numbers and back.  The
   translation need not be one-to-one, which means that one register
   can have several names.  A register name can, however, only
   translate to a single register number.

   Often, registers are grouped in <i>register banks</i>, where
   registers in the bank are numbered from 0 up. Registers in a bank
   should have consecutive numbers (unless their numbering is very sparse).
   This allows a user to deduce register numbers by calling
   <fun>get_number</fun> for the first register only.
   The first register numbers should be used for the general-purpose integer 
   registers, if possible (so that integer register <b>r</b>N has number N).

   Using this interface to read or write registers does not cause any
   side effects, such as triggering interrupts or signalling haps.

   <b>get_number</b> translates a register name to its number. Returns -1 if
   the register does not exist.

   <b>get_name</b> translates a register number to its canonical name.

   <b>read</b> reads a register value.

   <b>write</b> writes a new register value.

   <b>all_registers</b> returns a list of all register numbers that can
   be used for this object.

   <b>register_info</b> returns information about a single register.
   The information return depends on the <param>info</param> parameter.
