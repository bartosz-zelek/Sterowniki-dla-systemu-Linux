    <tt>-trace-data</tt> : Enabling tracing of data operations.
    <br/><tt>-trace-instructions</tt> : Enabling tracing of instruction.
    <br/><tt>-trace-exceptions</tt> : Enabling tracing of exceptions.

    The following flags allow controlling the output:

    <br/><tt>-print-register-changes</tt> : Print register changes after
    traced instruction and/or traced exception.
    Registers that normally change with every instruction, like program counter
    or cycles counter, are not listed.
    <br/><tt>-print-old-value</tt> : Print the previous register value together
    with register changes.
    <br/><tt>-print-virtual-address</tt> : Print the virtual address of an
    entry.
    <br/><tt>-print-physical-address</tt> : Print the physical address of an
    entry.
    <br/><tt>-print-linear-address</tt> : Print the linear address of an entry
    (only x86).
    <br/><tt>-print-opcode</tt> : Print the opcode of an instruction entry.
    <br/><tt>-print-access-type</tt> : Print the access type (only x86).
    <br/><tt>-print-memory-type</tt> : Print the memory type (only x86).
    <br/><tt>-use-cpu-number</tt> : Print the CPU number instead of its name.
    <br/><tt>-remove-duplicates</tt> : Remove duplicated lines from
    the output.

    If none of the <tt>-print...</tt> or <tt>-trace..</tt> flags are
    given all of those will be enabled by default except
    <tt>-print-register-changes</tt>, i.e., trace and print everything
    except register changes.
