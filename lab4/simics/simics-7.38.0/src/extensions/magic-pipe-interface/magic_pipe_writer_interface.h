/* <add id="magic_pipe_writer_interface_t">

  An interface for writing transmit data to a magic pipe application running in
  the target system. This interface is called by a simics extension running in
  the host system which communicates with a target application through a magic
  pipe. The communication is identified by a magic number. These numbers are
  acquired or reserved in the magic_pipe_setup_interface.

  The write functions operate on an unfragmented host system buffer. All C-code
  writer callback functions are allowed direct access to the unfragmented host
  buffer, while Python callback functions require the data to be copied from a
  Python owned data buffer.

  The target system pipe buffer is not modified until all writer callbacks for
  its magic number have returned. Then the pipe buffer header is updated and
  the whole unfragmented host buffer is copied into the target pipe buffer
  fragments.

    <note>This interface is an experimental feature. It is excluded from
  the standard support program, and is subject to change or removal
  without notice.</note>

           function must be called also to update the amount of used data in
           the pipe buffer and advance the write position.
