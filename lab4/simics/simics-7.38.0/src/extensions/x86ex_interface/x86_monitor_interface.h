/* <add id="x86_monitor_interface_t">
    This interface is meant to be implemented by an uncore device to support
    implementation of MONITOR/MWAIT instruction pair. A listener (e.g. a cpu)
    uses this interface to setup monitored write-back memory range.
    All listeners subscribed to a particular write-back memory range will be
    notified via <b>x86_monitor_notification_interface</b> when a memory write
    transaction hits the monitored memory range.

    This interface is internal and may change without notice.

    The <b>arm</b> method is to subscribe for notifications about writes to
    a write-back memory range starting from <b>start_address</b> up to
    <b>start_address</b> + <b>length</b> - 1 , returns true on success.
    The <b>disarm</b> unsubscribes <b>listener</b>, so the latter won't be
    notified about writes to a monitored memory range, returns true on success.
