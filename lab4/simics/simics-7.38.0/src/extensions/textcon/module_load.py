The command supports common escape sequences such as &quot;\\n&quot; for new
line and &quot;\\t&quot; for tab.

Octal or hexadecimal escape sequences can be used to send control characters to
the console, for example &quot;\\003&quot; or &quot;\\x03&quot; for Ctrl-C.

If <tt>-e</tt> is specified, then the string is interpreted as an
Emacs-style keystroke sequence. The following characters and modifiers
are accepted: 'C' (Ctrl), 'A' (Alt), 'S (Shift)', 'Enter',
'Backspace', 'Del', 'Up', 'Down', 'Left', 'Right', 'Esc', 'Tab',
'Home', 'End', 'Ins', 'Spc', 'PgDn', 'PgUp', 'F1' to 'F12', keypad
keys 'Kp_0' to 'Kp_9', 'Kp_Plus', 'Kp_Minus', 'Kp_Mul', 'Kp_Div',
'Kp_Dot', 'Kp_Enter' as well as regular alpha-numeric characters,
i.e. [a-zA-Z0-9_?]. Key strokes are delimited by whitespace, and
characters/modifiers are combined using the '-' character. For
example, "C-a" will input Ctrl and 'a' pressed together, "C-a a" will
do that followed by a single 'a' but "C-aa" is invalid. "C-A-Del" will
produce the famous Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence. Modifiers cannot be sent
individually, so e.g. "C" will send the character 'C', not Ctrl.
