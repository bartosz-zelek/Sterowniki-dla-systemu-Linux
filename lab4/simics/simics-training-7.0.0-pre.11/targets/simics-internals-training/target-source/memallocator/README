Program used to demonstrate and do labs with
the Simics simulator image system in the 
Simics Internals training. 

The idea is to allocate a huge area of memory
and then write to each page a few times in order
to force Simics to represent the pages.  

Included binary is built on the target to run
while still being minimal in size.  It is also very
likely that a build on a regular x86 Linux host 
linked with -static will work on the QSP Linux. 
But such a binary gets to be quite a bit bigger, 
and less reliable.
