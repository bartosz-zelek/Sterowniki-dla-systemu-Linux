        type: bool
        default: false
        description: >-
          Create a framebuffer that outputs to graphics console when writing to
          it's buffer.
      address:

        default: 0xd0000000
        description: Address where the framebuffer is mapped in memory.

        type: int
        values: [16, 32, 64]
        required: false
        description: >-
          x86 execution mode, 16, 32 or 64. If not given the target will attempt
          to select execution mode based on the given binary. If neither mode or
          binary is given then 64-bit mode will be used.
      stack_pointer:
        type: u64
        default: 0xc0000000
        description: >-
          Initial stack pointer value. This is ignored for 16-bit mode.
      pc:
        type: u64
        required: false
        description: >-
          Initial program counter value. If not given and software:binary is
          set, then the entry point of the binary will be used. If neither this
          nor software:binary is not given the initial program counter will be
          the default value from the model.
      page_table_base:
        type: u64
        default: 0xf0000000
        description: >-
          Page directoty base for paging. Page table entries will be written in
          memory at addresses following the base address. Paging is only enabled
          in 64-bit mode, for other modes this is ignored. Must be 64kb aligned.

    software:
      binary:
        type: file
        required: false
        description: >-
          Bare metal application. Needs to be in a known binary format supported
          by the load-binary commad, such as ELF or PE.
          To load as a raw file, used software:raw parameter.
      raw:
        type: bool
        default: false
        description: >-
          Load raw contents of software:binary into memory using load-file
          command.
      relocation:
        type: i64
        default: 0
        description: >-
          Relocation for the loaded binary, given as a relative offset.

    simulation:
      advanced: 2
      use_vmp:
        type: bool
        default: true
        description: >-
          Enables host virtualization (VMP) for better simulation performance.
          This option affects simulated time. See the performance chapter in the
          Simics User's Guide for more information about VMP.


  debugging:
    advanced: 2
    enable:
      type: bool
      default: false
      description: >-
        Will enable debugger by running the enable-debugger command.

    add_symbols:
      type: bool
      required: false
      description: >-
        Will perform add-symbol-file on the given machine:software:binary.

        If set this specifies if symbols should be added or not. If not set
        symbols are added when debugging:enable is TRUE.
