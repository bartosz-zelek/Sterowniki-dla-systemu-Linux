<h1 id="quick-start-platform-x86-reference-manual"><a href="#quick-start-platform-x86-reference-manual">Quick-Start Platform x86 Reference Manual</a></h1>
<p>This manual contains the reference documentation for the Quick-Start Platform x86 add-on package.
It includes a complete list of all command line commands defined by this package.
It also provides documentation on the available components and classes.
Finally, it describes the interfaces and haps that are available for scripting and developing models.
Note that whenever this manual refers to an item not documented here (class, interfaces or hap), the corresponding documentation can be found in the main <a href="../rm-base/index.html">Simics Reference Manual</a>.</p>
<p>This manual is aimed at normal Simics users (the command list chapter, and possibly the lists of components and classes), script developers (haps, classes, and interfaces), and model developers (the entire manual).</p>
<p>This manual is strictly meant to be used as reference documentation, and it provides little explanation on how to use the various features described.
Refer to other Simics manuals for more information; these are listed in the <a href="../DOCUMENTATION/index.html">Documentation Contents</a> document.</p>
