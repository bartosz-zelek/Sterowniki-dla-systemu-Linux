Compiling the Simics Agent
--------------------------

Unless you want to compile the Simics Agent with the default system compiler,
you need to specify the PREFIX environment variable. It should be set to the
path and file prefix of your target compiler.

Build:

  make

Currently, the Simics Agent does not provide complete dependency checking for
its files, thus it may be necessary to clean the old object files before
recompiling:

  make clean all

Remember that the agent is using Magic Instructions. You may have to update
the agent.c:trigger_agent function for your particular target system.

The Simics Agent options
------------------------

The agent takes several optional command-line options. Use --help to list them:

$ ./simics-agent --help
USAGE: ./simics-agent [OPTIONS] [<agent name>]
OPTIONS:
  -d, --debug [false]
	Print debug information
  -h, --help [true]
	Print this help information
  --id=b6cde764dc5add0e
	Override the agent magic id
  --name=<string>
	Set the Simics agent name
  --poll=10000
	Set the poll interval [milliseconds]
  -q, --quiet [verbosity=1]
	Make the agent more quiet
  -v, --verbose [verbosity=1]
	Make the agent more verbose
  --upload
        File to upload to host
  --download
        File to download from host
  --to
        Destination for file transfer
  -f, --overwrite
        Overwrite option for file transfer
  -x, --executable
        Executable option for file transfer


The agent name will be present among the available Simics agents which the
Agent Manager can list. The agent name can be used to differentiate separate
instances of the Simics agent, on the same or on different systems. Unless
specified on the command-line the hostname of the current target system will
be used. If the hostname is not set, a built-in default value is used.

When running the Simics agent to initiate file transfers, either the
--upload or --download option should be specified. Using --to is
optional and if specified directs the destination for the
transfer. The agent exits when the transfer is complete or if an error
occurs.

Debugging the Simics Agent
--------------------------

The Simics Agent takes an optional debug flag:

  ./simics-agent --debug

It can also be useful to turn on more log messages from either the agent
manager or your agent handle, in the Simics CLI:

  agent_manager.log-level 4
  matic0.log-level 4
