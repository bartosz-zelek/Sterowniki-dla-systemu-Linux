This is a sample test of the DEC21140A Ethernet controller.

The tests only cover a very small part of this complex device, but
they are written to illustrate various testing methods. In particular,
they show how to test a device that interacts with its environment in
various ways: network packet transmission, memory access (DMA), PCI
bus configuration, and interrupts.
