   <ndx>request!osa_control interface method</ndx> <fun>request</fun> is used
   to register clients that are interested in using the tracker framework and
   activates the tracker framework if it is not already activated. The
   <arg>initiator</arg> argument is a string which should describe the client
   that requests to activate the OS Awareness framework. The return value is an
   ID that should be passed to the <fun>release</fun> function to signal that
   the client no longer needs the OS Awareness framework.

   Upon a failure while initializing the OS Awareness framework,
   OSA_Request_Error_ID will be returned.

   <ndx>release!osa_control interface method</ndx> <fun>release</fun> removes a
   client that has previously requested to use the tracker framework. The
   <arg>id</arg> argument is the returned value from <fun>request</fun>. The
   tracker framework will be disabled when there are no more registered users.
