   <add id="breakpoint_type_interface_t">

   The <iface>breakpoint_type</iface> interface is implemented by the
   breakpoint manager and facilitates registering breakpoint types.

   This interface is currently a tech preview and can be changed at any time.

   The <fun>register_type</fun> method registers a breakpoint type and creates
   CLI commands for this type. The <arg>name</arg> parameter should be the
   unique name for the type, which is also used in the names of any commands
   registered on interfaces or class. The <arg>provider</arg> parameter should
   be the provider object, which must implement the
   <iface>breakpoint_type_provider</iface> interface.

   The registered commands are <cmd>break</cmd>, <cmd>run-until</cmd>,
   <cmd>wait-for</cmd>, <cmd>trace</cmd> and <cmd>untrace</cmd>, which are
   registered on the provider class. If <arg>cls</arg> or <arg>iface</arg> are
   non-NULL, commands are also registered on that class or interface. These
   commands are <cmd>bp-break-{name}</cmd>, <cmd>bp-run-until-{name}</cmd>,
   <cmd>bp-wait-for-{name}</cmd>, <cmd>bp-trace-{name}</cmd> and
   <cmd>bp-untrace-{name}</cmd>, where {name} is the <arg>name</arg> parameter.

   The <arg>cls</arg> and <arg>iface</arg> parameters cannot both be non-NULL.

   The <arg>args</arg> parameter is a list that defines the CLI command
   arguments. It should be a list of lists where each inner list contains the
   name of the cli.Arg_type subclass, such as <tt>str_t</tt>, <tt>flag_t</tt>
   etc, and then all parameters to its constructor (including values for
   parameters that have default values).

   The <arg>docs</arg> parameter should be an 8-element list with short and
   long command documentation texts for the four commands <cmd>break</cmd>,
   <cmd>run-until</cmd>, <cmd>wait-for</cmd> and <cmd>trace</cmd>.

   The <arg>object_required</arg> parameter indicates if the commands
   registered on the provider class (as opposed to the commands on the class or
   interface) should require an object (or if the command can use a default
   object). Note that there will only be an object parameter if <arg>cls</arg>
   or <arg>iface</arg> are non-NULL.

   The <arg>temporary_default</arg> parameter indicates if the breakpoints of
   this type should be temporary by default. This also results in the generated
   break command not having a -once flag.

   Setting <arg>recursive</arg> to true will append a '-recursive' flag to both
   global and object commands, and for the global command, the 'object'
   argument will have no specified class or iface.

   The <fun>trigger</fun> method must be called by the provider every time a
   breakpoint triggers, both breakpoints added with <fun>register_bp</fun>
   method and those added with <fun>add_bp</fun> method of the
   <iface>breakpoint_type_provider</iface> interface.

/*
   <add id="breakpoint_type_provider_interface_t">

   The <iface>breakpoint_type_provider</iface> interface should be implemented
   by objects that wish to act as breakpoint type providers towards the
   breakpoint manager. An object that is passed to the breakpoint manager via
   the <fun>register_type</fun> method in the <iface>breakpoint_type</iface>
   interface must implement <iface>breakpoint_type_provider</iface>.

   This interface is currently a tech preview and can be changed at any time.

   The <fun>register_bp</fun> and <fun>add_bp</fun> methods receives the
   command arguments, corresponding to what the breakpoint manager received in
   the <fun>register_type</fun>. The <fun>register_bp</fun> method should set
   up a breakpoint, register it with the breakpoint manager via the
   <iface>breakpoint_registration</iface> interface, and return the breakpoint
   manager ID for that breakpoint. The <fun>add_bp</fun> method should set up
   an internal breakpoint, which is not registered with the breakpoint manager,
   and return a provider-specific ID for this breakpoint. The breakpoint
   manager will use this ID to remove the breakpoint via the
   <fun>remove_bp</fun> method, and this ID should also be used when calling
   the <fun>trigger</fun> method in the <iface>breakpoint_type</iface>
   interface.

   The <fun>register_bp</fun> and <fun>add_bp</fun> methods should return 0 to
   indicate an error in setting up the breakpoint.

   The <fun>break_msg</fun> method should return the message that should be
   printed by the <cmd>bp.break</cmd> command after the breakpoint is set
   up. It receives the breakpoint manager ID for the breakpoint.

   The <fun>trace_msg</fun> method should return the message that should be
   printed when an (internal) trace breakpoint has hit. It receives the
   provider specific ID for the breakpoint.

   The <fun>wait_msg</fun> method should return the message that is attached to
   the script branch while waiting for a breakpoint to hit (displayed by
   e.g. <cmd>list-script-branches</cmd>). It receives the provider specific ID
   for the breakpoint.

   The optional method <fun>break_data</fun> can be implemented to make the
   <cmd>wait-for</cmd> and <cmd>run-until</cmd> commands return something. It
   receives the provider specific ID for the breakpoint.

   The method <fun>values</fun> must be implemented if the provider has
   specified that CLI command expanders should be used, when registering the
   breakpoint type. Otherwise the method is not called by the breakpoint
   manager. It should return the possible values for the command argument
   <arg>arg</arg>, which will be one of the argument names used when
   registering the type. The parameter <arg>prev_args</arg> will be the list of
   preceding argument values.

   The <fun>deleted</fun> method is typically optional. If implemented, it is
   called by the <fun>deleted</fun> function of
   the <iface>breakpoint_registration</iface> interface. Normally,
   breakpoint manager
   registered breakpoints are deleted using the function that was given
   to the <fun>register_breakpoint</fun> method of the
   <iface>breakpoint_registration</iface> interface, which is used by the
   <cmd>bp.delete</cmd>, but if the breakpoint can be removed by other means,
   then this method can be implemented.
