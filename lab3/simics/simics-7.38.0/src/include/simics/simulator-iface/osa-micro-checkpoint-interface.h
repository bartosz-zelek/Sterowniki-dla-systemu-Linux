   This interface is used to get information when micro checkpointing (for
   reverse execution) starts and stops. The functions will only be called
   when the tracker framework is enabled.

   <ndx>started!osa_micro_checkpoint interface method</ndx>
   <fun>started</fun> is called when a saved state is about to be loaded,
   before any attributes have been set.

   <ndx>finished!osa_micro_checkpoint interface method</ndx>
   <fun>finished</fun> is called once all attributes have been set for all
   objects. At this point callbacks calls to the machine interfaces can be
   done.

   It is allowed to implement only one of these functions if notification are
   only wanted before or after setting attributes of a micro checkpoint.

   This interface is optional and can be implemented by either a tracker or a
   mapper.
