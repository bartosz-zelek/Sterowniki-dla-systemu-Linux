/* <add id="checkpoint_interface_t">
   The <fun>save</fun> function in this interface is called when a checkpoint
   is saved, right before the attributes of an object is read. If defined,
   it should prepare the object for checkpointing, saving any state to
   <param>path</param> that is not directly included in the attributes.
   Default behavior is image to be compressed craff and config to be compressed
   too. Errors are signalled through exceptions.

   The <fun>save_v2</fun> function is same as <fun>save</fun> but take an extra
   parameter with the type of save_flags_t to control format of files in the
   checkpoint other than defaults.

   The <param>path</param> argument may be the empty string, which indicates
   that the checkpoint bundle directory is the same as the current working
   directory while the checkpoint is being saved.

   The <fun>finish</fun> function is called after the checkpoint has been
   saved, for all objects that <fun>save</fun> was called for. If
   <arg>success</arg> is nonzero, the checkpoint was saved successfully;
   otherwise there was a failure. This permits the object to clean up temporary
   data structures and files in either case. In particular, any files written
   to <param>path</param> in the <fun>save</fun> method must be removed in
   <fun>finish</fun> if <param>success</param> is zero.

   The function <fun>has_persistent_data</fun>, if implemented, should return
   0 if the object only has volatile attributes, 1 otherwise. This overrides
   <const>Sim_Attr_Persistent</const> on individual attributes.
