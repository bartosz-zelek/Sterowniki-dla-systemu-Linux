   This interface is implemented by the
   <class>instrumentation_filter_aggregator</class> class objects,
   here referred to as "aggregator". The interface should be
   called by instrumentation filters to enable or disable a connection.
   The aggregator object is located between the filters and the connection,
   keeping the connections unaware of multiple filters that might
   be disabling them.

   The <fun>disable</fun> method tells the aggregator that the unique
   <param>source_id</param> currently wants to disable the connection.
   As long as there is one <param>source_id</param> that is disabled,
   the connection is disabled. Only when all sources are enabled
   the connection is enabled.

   Similarly, the <fun>enable</fun> enables the connection. That
   is, the filter is now in a state when it thinks the connection
   should be enabled.

/* <add id="instrumentation_filter_master_interface_t">

   This interface is intended to be implemented by instrumentation filters.
   Instrumentation filters should enable the associated slaves, which
   themselves are associated with instrumentation connections.

   The <fun>set_source_id</fun> method supplies the filter with an unique
   source number for the filter. This function should only be called once,
   the filter needs to store this number so it can be used when 
   calling the <iface>instrumentation_filter_slave</iface> interface
   methods.

   The <fun>add_slave</fun> method informs the filter that it should enable or
   disable this slave too. The <param>slave</param> object should implement the
   <iface>instrumentation_filter_slave</iface> interface which should be
   used. The <param>provider_obj</param> parameter is the provider object that
   is located behind the slave and its connection.  Depending on how the filter
   works, it may or may not make use of this parameter. For example, the
   process-filter might detect that the filtered process is now running on a
   particular processor, then it can enable this particular connection only,
   given that it can match the <param>provider_obj</param> with the processor
   currently running the tracked process.

   The <fun>remove_slave</fun> method removes a slave from the filter, so
   it should not call it anymore.

   The <fun>short_filter_config</fun> method should return a short textual
   description on how the filter is currently set up. This information
   is used in various print commands.
