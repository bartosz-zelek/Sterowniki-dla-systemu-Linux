/* <add id="instrumentation_order_interface_t"> 

   This interface is used to control the dispatch order of connected
   instrumentation. It is implemented by instrumentation providers that have
   the ability to change the order in which instrumentation events occur. This
   works by associating every instrumentation event with a connection
   object. It is up to the provider to supply a way to do this. See the
   <iface>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</iface> interface for an example.  Most
   users of any instrumentation will only be observing the state of the
   provider, in which case the order is unimportant. However, if users
   of instrumentation may change the behavior of the provider, this interface
   may be useful.

   The default order for callbacks that should be honored by all providers,
   where possible, regardless if they implement the
   <iface>instrumentation_order</iface> interface or not is:

   <ol>
   <li>all anonymous connections, i.e. NULL connections, in registration order</li>
   <li>connection order, which if not re-ordered will be the connection
   registration order</li>
   <li>callback registration order</li>
   </ol>

   The <arg>get_connections</arg> method should return an
   <type>attr_value_t</type> list with connection objects that represent the
   current order. The first element in the list is the first object in the
   dispatch order, etc.

   The <arg>move_before</arg> method moves the connection given by the
   <arg>connection</arg> argument before the connection given by the
   <arg>anchor</arg> argument. If the <arg>anchor</arg> is NULL the connection
   will be moved last. The given connection objects must be present in the
   current dispatch order for this to succeed.
