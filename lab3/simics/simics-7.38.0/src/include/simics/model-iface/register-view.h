           [NAME, DESC, SIZE, OFFSET, BITFIELDS, BIG_ENDIAN_BYTE_ORDER].
           All but the two last
           element in the list are required and the client should
           tolerate if more than 6 elements are presented in the list.
           NAME must be a valid identifier. DESC is a short description
           of the register. SIZE is the number of bytes of the register,
           could only be 1, 2, 4, or 8. OFFSET is the offset into the bank
           and can be Nil denoting non-memory-mapped registers.
           BITFIELDS is optional and if present, is a list where each
           element itself being a list of [NAME, DESC, LSB, MSB] where
           NAME and DESC is the identifier and description of the field
           and LSB and MSB are the least significant and the most significant
           bit in little-endian bitorder. MSB is optional and if omitted,
           is assumed to be the same as LSB, i.e., the bitfield specifies
           a single bit.
           BIG_ENDIAN_BYTE_ORDER is an optional boolean value, assumed to be
           False if omitted. It controls the byte order of the register's
           memory-mapped representation; the byte at OFFSET is the
           most significant byte if BIG_ENDIAN_BYTE_ORDER is True, and
           the least significant byte otherwise.
