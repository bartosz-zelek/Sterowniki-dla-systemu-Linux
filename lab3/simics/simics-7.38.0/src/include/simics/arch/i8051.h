   The <fun>active_interrupt()</fun> function returns the interrupt vector
   address of the highest pending interrupt. This function should only be
   called when the processor should take an interrupt. This function may also
   set internal interrupt controller state, which can be cleared by the
   <fun>reti</fun> function call when returning from the interrupt.

   The <fun>reti</fun> function is used to notify the interrupt controller that
   the currently active interrupt has completed.

   The <fun>suppress_irq</fun> function is used to determine whether interrupt 
   should be blocked after a writing access to a memory location.

   The <fun>change_mode</fun> function is used to change the working mode (e.g.
   16bit timer, 8 bit timer or event counting etc.)
   of the timer.

   The <fun>switch_timer</fun> function is used to enable or disable
   the timer. Timers can be switched on or off by either software or hardware.
   The parameter caller is either 0 or 1, indicating the control
   is from software or hardware. Only when the timer is switched on or off
   by hardware, the third parameter onoff is used, which indicates
   whether the timer is to be enabled or disabled.
