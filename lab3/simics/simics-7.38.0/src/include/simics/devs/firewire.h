   This interface must be implemented by all firewire buses.

   <fun>connect_device</fun> is called when a device wants to connect to the
   bus. The bus should return 0 upon success.

   <fun>disconnect_device</fun> is called when a device wants to disconnect
   from the bus. The bus should return 0 upon success.
   
   <fun>set_device_bus_id</fun> sets the bus id for the device. This needs to
   be called by a device when its Node_IDS[bus_id] field is updated. The
   new bus id should be placed in bits 15-6 in the bus_id argument.

   <fun>set_id_mask</fun> can be called by a device to specify a mask that
   should be applied to the device ID when routing transfers. This can be
   used to e.g. accept transfers to multiple bus-numbers.

   <fun>transfer</fun> sends a packet. The bus will
   route the transfer to the correct device(s). The <param>source</param>
   parameter should be set to the device which sent the transfer. The bus uses
   this parameter to avoid sending packets to their sender. If the
   <param>crc_calculated</param> argument
   is non-zero the packet's crc fields are filled in.The return code is one
   of:

   <insert id="firewire_ack_code_t"/>

   <fun>register_channel</fun> can be called to tell the bus that the device
   want to receive isochronous transfers to channel <param>channel</param>.
   channel must be in the range [0, 63).
   A device can register several channels. It is an error to subscribe a
   device to a channel it is already subscribed to.
   Returns 0 on success.

   <fun>unregister_channel</fun> tells the bus the device is no longer
   interested in transfers to channel <param>channel</param>. channel must be
   in the range [0, 63). It is an error to unsubscribe a device from a channel
   if it isn't subscribing to it. Returns 0 on success.

   <fun>reset</fun> can be called to cause a bus reset. After the bus reset,
   all the devices may have received new IDs.

   6 bits the node ID). <param>root_id</param> is the node ID for the root
   node. <param>self_ids</param> is the list of Self-ID packets
   during the Self-ID phase of the reset.

   <insert id="uint32_array_t"/>

   <fun>get_self_id_template</fun> is an accessor function called by the bus
   or other self-ID provider to provide the static parts of the Self-ID for
   this device. The ID and port parts will be overwritten by the Self-ID
   provider.

   <fun>get_rhb</fun> gets the current status of the root hold off bit in the
   device.

   <fun>get_port_count</fun> returns the number of ports the device has. The
   largest allowed value is 16 and the lowest 1. This should remain constant
   during the lifetime of the device and always return a valid value.

   <fun>get_port_mask</fun> returns a bitmask. Each bit is one if that port is
   enabled and zero if it is disabled. The least significant bit describes port
   0 and the most significant bit port 15. The bits for ports which do not
   exist on the device should be set to zero.
