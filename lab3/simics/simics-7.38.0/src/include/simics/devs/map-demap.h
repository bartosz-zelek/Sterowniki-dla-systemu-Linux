/* <add id="map_demap_interface_t">
   Interface used to dynamically add and remove mappings in a memory space.
   The first argument to all functions, <param>space</param> is the memory
   space to map an object in.

   The <fun>map_simple</fun> function adds a device/port pair to the
   memory map. The added device (port) must implement either the
   <iface>ram</iface>, <iface>rom</iface>, <iface>io_memory</iface>,
   <iface>port_space</iface>, <iface>translator</iface>,
   <iface>transaction_translator</iface>, <iface>transaction</iface> or
   <iface>memory_space</iface> interfaces.
   
   The <fun>map_bridge</fun> function adds a device/port pair to the
   memory map to act as a bridge that translates memory accesses
   before passing them on to another object. The added device (port)
   must implement either the <iface>translate</iface> interface or the
   <iface>bridge</iface> interface, and the <param>target</param> and
   <param>target_port</param> parameter specifies the object behind
   the bridge. The target is typically another memory space.
   
   The <fun>unmap</fun> removes an object from the memory map. The
   <param>dev</param> and <param>port</param> parameters are the same
   as those given to the <fun>map_simple</fun> and
   <fun>map_bridge</fun> functions.
   
   The <fun>unmap_address</fun> removes all mappings that map
   <param>object</param> and start at the <param>base</param> address.
   
   The <fun>add_map</fun>, <fun>remove_map</fun>,
   <fun>add_default</fun> and <fun>remove_default</fun> functions are
   deprecated and should not be used.
   Both <tt>base</tt> and <tt>length</tt> of the <tt>map_info_t</tt> structure
   should be 0 to map a <tt>default_target</tt>.

   All functions in the <iface>map_demap</iface> return 1 on success and 0 on
   failure.

   More information about the different kinds of memory space mappings is
   available in Simics Model Builder User's Guide.
