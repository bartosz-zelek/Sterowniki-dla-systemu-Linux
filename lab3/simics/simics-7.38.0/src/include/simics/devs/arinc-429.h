/* Arinc-429 is a two-wire serial protocol used in avionics. The bus
   consists of one transmitter and 1-20 receivers. The rate is either
   12.5 or 100 kbps. The lines have three states: NULL, high, low, and
   is self-clocking.
   Each data packet is 32 bits. Bit 31 is the parity bit.
   The whole word should be of odd parity. The rest of the data is
   up to the sensor type, a list of sensors and the data encoding can
   be found at
   http://www.condoreng.com/support/downloads/tutorials/ARINCTutorial.pdf

   The <fun>send_word</fun> function is used by a device to send an
