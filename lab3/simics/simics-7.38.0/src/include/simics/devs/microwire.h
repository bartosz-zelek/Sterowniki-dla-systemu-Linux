/* <add id="microwire_interface_t">
   This interface is used to communicate with a 3-wire
   (microwire) serial EEPROM device, for example, the 93Cxx
   series, via its pins. To set the values of the CS, SK, and
   DI pins, use the <fun>set_cs()</fun>, <fun>set_sk()</fun>,
   and <fun>set_di()</fun> functions, respectively. To read the
   value output on the DO pin, use the <fun>get_do()</fun>
   function. Zero represents low signal and non-zero high
   signal. The <fun>read_word()</fun> and <fun>write_word()</fun>
   functions are provided to shortcut high-level operations.
   They operate on 8-bit or 16-bit entities depending on the
   width of the eeprom.
