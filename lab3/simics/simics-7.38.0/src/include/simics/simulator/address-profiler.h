   <short>Iterate over address profile counters</short>

   An address profile iterator visits some of the counters of an address
   profiler in some order. It is obtained from the <fun>iter</fun> function of
   the <iface>address_profiler</iface> interface.

   <fun>SIM_iter_next</fun> advances the address profile iterator
   <param>iter</param> to the next nonzero counter and returns the count. It
   will return 0 when there are no more counters to visit. Note that the order
   in which the counters are visited is unspecified.

   <fun>SIM_iter_addr</fun> returns the address of the counter returned by the
   most recent call to <fun>iter_next</fun>.

   When you are done with the iterator, deallocate it with
   <fun>SIM_iter_free</fun>.
