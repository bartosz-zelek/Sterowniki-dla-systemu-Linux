Creates a new Simics command-line accessible using telnet on TCP port
<arg>port</arg> or on UNIX socket <arg>unix_socket</arg>. If neither
<arg>port</arg> nor <arg>unix_socket</arg> is specified, a currently
free port will be selected. If a busy port is specified the command
will fail. The port or UNIX socket actually used is returned by the
command.

The command will fail if a privileged TCP socket is specified or if
<arg>unix_socket</arg> specifies a file that already exists. UNIX sockets
are not supported on Windows.

The <tt>-non-interactive</tt> flag can be used to prepare for scripted,
non-interactive sessions. This prevents Simics from using fancy formatting and
coloring of the output and disables the asynchronous prompt for commands
running the simulation. The <tt>-plain-text</tt> flag can be used to only
disable output formatting. These two flags affect all future connections made
to the telnet frontend. The corresponding <attr>interactive</attr> and
<attr>plain_text</attr> attributes can be used to change the settings of an
already created <class>telnet-frontend</class> object, although existing
connections will not be affected.

It is possible to limit the number of allowed connections to the frontend with
the <arg>max-connections</arg> argument. Once this number of connections has
been reached, no new connections are allowed even if previous ones disconnect.
It is possible to reset the count of connections by writing directly to the
<attr>num_connections</attr> attribute in the <class>telnet-frontend</class>
class.
