   C-state transitions.

   The <arg>info</arg> contains information about the source of change and
   current C-state of the processor <arg>cpu</arg>.

   A state value of 0 corresponds to C0, a value of 1 corresponds to C1, etc.
   <b>HLT</b> is reported as state 1, substate 0.
   <b>MWAIT</b> is reported based upon the eax hint,
   decoded as state = (eax[7:4] + 1) mod 16, substate = eax[3:0].
