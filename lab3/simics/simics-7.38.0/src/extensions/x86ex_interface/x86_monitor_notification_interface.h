    This interface is meant to be implemented by a processor to support
    complex cases of MONITOR/MWAIT instruction pair. A processor will be
    notified about writes to the monitored write-back memory range through the
    <b>notify</b> method. The return value indicates whether to unsubscribe from
    notifications or not. See <b>x86_monitor_interface_t</b> to find out how to
    subscribe for write notifications to a write-back memory range.
