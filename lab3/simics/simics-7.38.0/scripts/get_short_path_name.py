# Utility to eliminate spaces from a Windows path by converting to an
# equivalent 8.3 form. This is actually unneeded, since we actually
# support spaces in build paths now. However, spaces in build paths
# impose a few additional requirements on module makefiles, so we have
# chosen to keep the conversion for a while to provide an easier
# migration. However, the use of file should eventually be phased out.
