# ## SUITEINFO
#
# Apart from defining its parent directory as a test suite, the contents of a
# `SUITEINFO` file can also define some properties of the test suite. Each
# line which does not start with a `#` character defines a parameter. The
# parameter definition is provided as the name of the parameter, a
# ':'-character, and finally the value for the parameter. Whitespace at the
# start and the end of the line is ignored, as well as whitespace characters
# around the ':'.
#
# Currently the following parameters are accepted:
#
# <div class="dl">
#
# - <span class="term">timeout</span>
#     The amount of time the suite is allowed to run before it is terminated
#     by the test system, measured in seconds. The value must be an integer.
#     The default value is 60 seconds.
# - <span class="term">disabled\_on\_hosts</span>
#     Host types (`linux64` or `win64`) on which the suite should not be run.
# - <span class="term">tags</span>
#     Space-separated list of tags for the suite. Each tag is an arbitrary
#     text; when a tag is passed to `test-runner` through the `--tag` argument,
#     then only suites containing that tag will be selected.
# </div>
#
# Using any other parameter name is currently considered a syntax error.
#
# Example SUITEINFO file:
# ```
# # give up after 5 minutes
# timeout: 300
# # do not run on Windows host
# disabled_on_hosts: win64
# # suite belongs to two groups
# tags: pci nightly
# ```
# }}
