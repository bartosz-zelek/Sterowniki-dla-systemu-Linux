<p>Simics does not explicitly support IDEs other than those listed in this manual. If you would like to use Simics with such an IDE, there are a few options you could try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Simics's own user interface to control the debugging process (see chapter <a class="reference" href="debug.html">3.2</a>).</li>
<li>If your IDE speaks the GDB serial protocol, try connecting it directly to Simics with the help of a <code>gdb-remote</code> object (see chapter <a class="reference" href="gdb.html">3.4</a>).</li>
<li>If your IDE uses GDB as a debugger backend, try to make this GDB instance connect to Simics with <code>gdb-remote</code>.</li>
</ul>
