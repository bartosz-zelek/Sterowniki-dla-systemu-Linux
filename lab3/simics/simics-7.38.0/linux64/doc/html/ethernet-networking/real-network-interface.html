<p>

</p><p>
When connecting to a real network on a host with multiple network interfaces
installed, Simics will select one of them for the real network connection. If
the default selection is incorrect, all commands have an <i>interface</i>
argument to select the desired interface. The interface name expected by
the <i>interface</i> argument is the ordinary interface name used by the
host operating system. The next two sections describe how to obtain the names
of the simulation host's network interfaces for Linux and Windows hosts.
