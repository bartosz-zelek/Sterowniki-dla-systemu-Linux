<dt class="jdocu_descitem">Description</dt><dd class="jdocu_descitem">Triggered when a configuration has been loaded. This hap can be triggered several times during a session since it is possible to append a new configuration to the existing one. In most cases it is better to use the <b><i>finalize_instance</i></b> function in the <code>class_data_t</code> instead. That function is called when the object creation is finished. Callbacks are called in Global Context.</dd>
