</h2>
 Enable the page-sharing feature, which detects identical pages in the systems being simulated. Pages can be RAM, ROM, flash, disk, or any page represented by <tt>image</tt> objects.
<p>
Pages detected to have identical contents are replaced with a single read-only copy, consequently reducing the amount of host memory used. If an identical page is written to, it will again get a private writable instance of the page.
</p><p>
Identical pages are detected during run-time by certain triggers. If the <tt>-now</tt> switch is used, all currently active pages will be examined for sharing directly. Disabling page-sharing only means that no more pages will be shared, pages which have already been shared will not be un-shared.
