 Add a new probe-kind called <i>name</i> which is the percent of the <i>numerator-probe</i> compared to the <i>denominator-probe</i>. The <i>display-name</i> can be used when presenting the probe in a monitor tool or similar.
<p>
For all objects that have the numerator probe and the denominator probe (the owner object of the probes is the same) a new percent probe will be created for that object.
</p><p>
If one of the numerator or denominator probes is a global probe (i.e. only one probe exists in the system and it does not belong to an object) and the other has an owner object, a new percent probe will be created for the nonomator or denominator that has the owner object. Each of the new percent probes for the owner objects will then relate to the single global probe as either numerator or denominator.
</p><p>
If both probes are global only one new global probe will be created that is the percent of the numerator and the denominator probes.
</p><p>
The numerator and denominator must be of the following types: "int", "int128", "float", or "fraction".
