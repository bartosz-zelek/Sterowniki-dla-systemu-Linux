<h2 id="supported-hardware-features"><a href="#supported-hardware-features">Supported Hardware Features</a></h2>
<p>Simics PCIe modeling library supports up to <strong>PCI Express Base
Specification Revision 6.0</strong>. Some of the features it supports with
little or no modeling effort are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending and receiving PCIe Messages</li>
<li>Upstream and downstream I/O and Memory operations</li>
<li>Legacy PCI Interrupts</li>
<li>Message Signalled Interrupts (MSI)</li>
<li>Message Signalled Interrupts X (MSI-X)</li>
<li>Resizable BARs (RBAR)</li>
<li>Virtual Function Resizable BARs (VFRBAR)</li>
<li>Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)</li>
<li>Address Translation Service (ATS)</li>
</ul>

<p>PCIe is simulated in Simics on a functional level, which means that
models typically operate slightly above the Transaction Layer. Simics
does not simulate individual TLPs, it simulates relevant parts of the
TLP and conveys the information along the route to the target
destination.</p>
<p>A Transaction Layer Package (TLP) in PCIe comes in four different
types: Config, Memory, I/O, and Message. All of these are issued using
the <code>transaction_t</code> data structure. The various bits of information
required to complete an operation (PASID, RequesterID, etc.) are
attached to the <code>transaction_t</code> as <code>atoms</code>.</p>
