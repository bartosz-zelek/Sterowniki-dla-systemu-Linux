<p>
  
</p><p>
The SystemC Library has been moved out of the Simics Base package to
a separate package 1013 (*SystemC-Library*). Users migrating to Simics
version 6.0.207 or later will need to install package 1013 to continue
using SystemC.
</p><p>
The build process and usage of the SystemC Library remain unchanged,
and no modifications are required for users' existing SystemC modules.
However, since the <code>SCL_VERSION</code> has been updated, both the
SystemC Library and the SystemC modules must be rebuilt following the
migration.
