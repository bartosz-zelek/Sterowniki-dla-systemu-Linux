<p>
  
</p><p>
  With a Windows image configured as shown in section
  <a class="reference" href="setup-windows-debug.html">2.3</a>, you are ready to set up the network
  connections to allow WinDbg on the host to connect to the target system. This
  requires setting up an <b>outbound port translation</b> in Simics. The reason
  is that WinDbg connections are initiated from the target system, and not from
  the debugger. When kernel or boot debug is enabled, Windows will periodically
  reach out to the IP and port you configured above, and see if there is a
  WinDbg running there and listening to connections from the target.
