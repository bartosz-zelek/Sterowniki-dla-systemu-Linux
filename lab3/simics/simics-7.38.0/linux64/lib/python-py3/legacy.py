The 'legacy_build_id' should be the build id where the legacy change should take
place, for example to make something legacy in Simics 6, one would specify a
build id of 6000. Such a legacy change would often be added in Simics 5, or in
Simics 6 prior to its release. The 'warn_msg' argument should provide a warning
of what was set to legacy and reference should explain what to use instead.'''
