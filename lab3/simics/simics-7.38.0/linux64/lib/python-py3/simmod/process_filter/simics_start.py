            used to specify the process nodes to follow. A pattern can just be
            a simple string naming a process to track, e.g., "grep" or it can
            be a more complicated one. For more information about node path
            patterns see the Analyzer User Guide.

            To add a pattern either use the <arg>pattern</arg> argument or use
            the <cmd>&lt;process_pattern&gt;.add-pattern</cmd> command once a
            process_filter has been created. If no patterns are given nothing
            will be instrumented if the filter is added to a tool.

            The <arg>software-component</arg> argument specifies which
            os-awareness object to use.""")
