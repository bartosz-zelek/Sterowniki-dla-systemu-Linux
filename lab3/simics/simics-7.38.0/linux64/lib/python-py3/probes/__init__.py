"""Simics probes framework

The probes Python package allows convenient methods for accessing
all probes which has been registered in Simics.

When probes are enabled with the enable-probes command the probe
framework will create Python ProbeProxy objects for all existing
probes in the system. Any additional created objects with probes will
also automatically get ProbeProxy objects.
