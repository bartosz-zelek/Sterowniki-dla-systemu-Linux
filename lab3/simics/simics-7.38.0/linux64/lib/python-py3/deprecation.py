    '''Issue a deprecation warning depending on the current deprecation settings.

The depr_build_id should be the build id where the deprecation takes
place, for example to deprecate something in Simics 6 one would
specify a build id of 6000. Such a deprecation would often be
added in Simics 5, or in Simics 6 prior to its release.
This would cause a deprecation warning to be emitted in 5 if
the -wdeprecated flag (deprecation level 2) is given to Simics. In 6 and 7,
the message would be emitted by default (deprecation level
1), but it can be suppressed with the -no-wdeprecated flag
(deprecation level 0). The feature would be removed in 8.

warn_msg should provide a warning of what was deprecated and reference
should explain what to use instead.'''
