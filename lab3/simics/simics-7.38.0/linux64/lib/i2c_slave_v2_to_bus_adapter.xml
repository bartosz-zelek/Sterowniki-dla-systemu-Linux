The slave device must send all responses synchronously, i.e., before a start(), write() or read() call in the i2c_slave_v2 interface has returned, the slave it must have called the corresponding acknowledge() or read_response() method.  The adapter can be used on a single-master bus where the master device has not yet been upgraded to the new i2c_master_v2/i2c_slave_v2 interfaces, but one of the slave devices has." bitorder="le">
