  Interface for a button to interact with the panel controller. 
  - Check if a button is "hit" by a certain coordinate
  - A set of transitions/events:
    
    - When a button is clicked, it gets start_press()
      - Then, other events can show up:
        - If the user pulls the mouse out of the button, it gets leave_button()
        - If the user returns to the button, it then gets return_to_button()
      - If the user releases the button when in the button, it gets end_press()
      - If the user releases the button outside the button, it gets cancel_press()

  The corresponding DML definition can be found in p-control-button_interface.dml
