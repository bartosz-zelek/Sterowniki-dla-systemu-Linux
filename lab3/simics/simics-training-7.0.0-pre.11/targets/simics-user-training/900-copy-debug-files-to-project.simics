# Debug where things get run:

#list-packages

## Preparatory script to make going through the Simics debug labs a bit easier.
## It copies the relevant directories from the installation to the Simics project,
## to avoid the need to go looking through the Simics installation to find the 
## code. 
##

#
# Underlying logic:
#   %simics%/targets/simics-user-training/ will resolve to the user's project
#   since it exists after project-setup has done its job. 
#

$uproj = (lookup-file "%simics%/targets/simics-user-training/")
#echo $uproj

#
# Check if we already have the directories
# - Also avoids this script wreaking havoc in the development branch
# 
if (file-exists ($uproj + "/target-code")) {
    echo ""
    echo "  Files already exist in the user project, no need to do anything more"
    echo ""
    interrupt-script "Nothing to do for this script, since the files are already in place in the user's project"
}

#
# Copy executable target code directory
#  - This lookup-file command should resolve to the installed package, since it does not
#    exist in the project.  
# 
@import shutil
$tc = "target-code"
$tcode = (lookup-file "%simics%/targets/simics-user-training/%s" % [$tc] )
#echo $tcode
@shutil.copytree(simenv.tcode, ("%s/%s/" % (simenv.uproj, simenv.tc) ), copy_function=shutil.copy)

#
# Copy files directory
#
$f = "files"
$fs = (lookup-file "%simics%/targets/simics-user-training/%s" % [$f] )
#echo $fs
@shutil.copytree(simenv.fs, ("%s/%s/" % (simenv.uproj, simenv.f) ))

#
# Copy target-source directory
# - So that the target software source code is available for debug labs
#
$f = "target-source"
$fs = (lookup-file "%simics%/targets/simics-user-training/%s" % [$f] )
#echo $fs

## Done!
