 * Class that implements the Simics direct_memory_update interface. What makes
 * this class a bit special, is that it is _not_ derived from GasketOwner.
 * This is because it does not carry any information for the forward-path TLM2
 * protocol. Instead, it is intended to be associated with a tlm2simics gasket
 * and use this gasket to get the target socket so that it can invalidate the
 * DMI using the backward-path of the TLM2 protocol.
