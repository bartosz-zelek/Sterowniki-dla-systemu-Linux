# Feature: TLM Socket Payload Injection
# Sockets, registered with the awareness framework, provide the Simics
# sc_tlm_fw_transport and sc_tlm_bw_transport interfaces. The interfaces
# correspond to the SystemC TLM2 transport interfaces and support injection.
# Test injecting a TLM transaction to read some data from bar0
