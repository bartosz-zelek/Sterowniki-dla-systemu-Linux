     <tt>identifier[17:0]</tt>.</li>

     <li><tt>extended</tt>: There isn't IDE in can_frame_t, instead,

     Standard frame.</li>

     instead, <tt>rtr</tt> is used to indicate if the frame is a remote frame or
     not. Here we don't care whether the frame is Extended frame or Standard
     frame.</li>
     
     <li><tt>data_length</tt>: The <tt>data_length</tt> contains the arithmetic
     value of the DLC.</li>
