        size    the preallocated size for buffer data.
        buf_p   the address of a buffer handle.

   At least one memory page must be allocated to fit the buffer header. More
   memory pages will be reserved as necessary to hold the messages.

   Note that any pointers to the data in the buffer may become invalid after
   this call, as the whole buffer may have moved to another address. Relative

        len             the extra space to reallocate for buffer data.
        align_bits      the number of bits to align to, or 0.

   The align_bits argument is optionally used to add padding to achieve
   alignment to the specified number of bits. This means that more than space
   than the len argument may be allocated.

        align_bits      the number of bits to align to, or 0.

   The align_bits argument is optionally used to add padding to achieve

   Arguments:
        buf     the buffer handle.
        data_p  the address of a buffer unused data pointer, or NULL.

   content and write new content in return.

   Arguments:

        buf     the outgoing buffer handle.

   The buffer handle is transformed into an incoming buffer handle with data
