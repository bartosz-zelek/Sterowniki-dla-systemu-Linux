   The <b>ioapic_eoi</b> method is used send end of interrupt to the
   all IOAPICs from APIC with <b>id</b> via APIC bus.

   The <b>interrupt</b> method is used to send interrupt from LAPIC to other
   APICs via APIC bus. There are several variants of recipients: all,
   all exclude self (to exclude self <b>exclude_id</b> should be specified and
   value of <b>exclude</b> should be true), self.
   Also <b>interrupt</b> method is not available from Python.
