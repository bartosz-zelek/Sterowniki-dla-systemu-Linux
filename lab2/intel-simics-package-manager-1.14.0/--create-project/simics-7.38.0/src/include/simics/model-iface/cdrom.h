/*
 * Interface implemented by objects representing a CD medium.
 *
 * The interface is internal and can change between major releases.
 *
 * The read_toc function retrieves the table of contents. buf needs to hold
 * 2048 bytes, but the actual number of used bytes are returned from the
 * call. start_track denotes the track to read the table of contents from. If
 * msf is nonzero, the table of contents should report in minute-second-frame
 * instead of logical block addressing.
 *
 * The total size of the medium, in number of 2048-byte blocks, is given by a
 * call to capacity().
 *
 * read_block() fills in the lba:th 2 KiB block on the medium into the given
 * buffer. -1 is returned on failure, 2048 on success.
 *
 * read_raw_block() reads all 2352 bytes of a block, including the preamble and
 * checksum. The function is optional. If left as NULL, the caller should fall
 * back to using read_block() and improvise the rest of the data. Returns -1 on
 * failure, and the number of bytes read (always 2352) on success.
 *
 * insert() and eject() are called when the CD is inserted respective ejected.
 * It is an error to insert a CD multiple times without ejecting it
 * first. insert() returns -1 on error, 0 on success.
