/* <add id="bank_instrumentation_subscribe_interface_t">

   The <iface>bank_instrumentation_subscribe</iface> interface is implemented
   by non-anonymous register banks. The interface may be used to monitor and
   modify register accesses using callbacks.

   Similar to the CPU instrumentation framework, a bank that implements the
   interface is considered an instrumentation provider and is typically used by
   an instrumentation tool. The tool registers callbacks using this interface
   and performs its actions once they are called. Using this interface, tools
   may also group registered callbacks using connection objects. This can be
   useful to enforce a certain evaluation order of grouped callbacks.

   The <arg>bank</arg> argument in all methods is the register bank object
   implementing this interface.

   The <arg>connection</arg> can be used to group registered callbacks
   together, so that their order may be changed or their registered
   callbacks be enabled, disabled, or removed collectively. If
   <arg>connection</arg> is NULL when registering a callback, the callback is
   considered anonymous. Anonymous callbacks are evaluated before any other
   callbacks in the order of creation. See <iface>instrumentation_order</iface>
   interface for more details on the callback order.

   Each registration method installs a callback which is called at a
   particular time, before or after, read and write register
   accesses. Callbacks are not invoked during inquiry accesses. Using
   the <arg>offset</arg> and <arg>size</arg> arguments, a user may
   install the callback only for a particular range. If
   <arg>offset</arg> and <arg>size</arg> are 0 the callback is
   installed for the entire bank.

   The <arg>user_data</arg> is used to associate user defined data with every
   callback. Every time the callback is invoked the data is provided as an
   argument to the callback.

   <insert-until text="// ADD INTERFACE bank_instrumentation_subscribe"/>

   Every function that registers a callback returns a unique handle of type
   <type>bank_callback_handle_t</type>. The <fun>remove_callback</fun> method
   uninstalls the callback associated with the handle.  The
   <fun>remove_connection_callbacks</fun> uninstalls all callbacks associated
   with a connection object. Similarly, the
   <fun>enable_connection_callbacks</fun> and
   <fun>disable_connection_callbacks</fun> methods are used to temporarily
   enable or disable a group of callbacks.

   Callback functions registered through the
   <iface>bank_instrumentation_subscribe</iface> interface are called before or
   after read and write accesses, like so:

   <insert id="before_read_callback_t"/>
   <insert id="after_read_callback_t"/>
   <insert id="before_write_callback_t"/>
   <insert id="after_write_callback_t"/>

   The <param>connection</param> is the object used to group the callback with
   any other callbacks, which may be NULL. The <param>access</param> object
   provides a number of methods which may be used along with the
   <param>handle</param> to perform a certain set of actions at the particular
   point of the access. The <param>user_data</param> is the custom data
   which was associated with the callback at registration.

   For every callback, additional information may be accessed using a specific
   interface which is passed as a parameter to the callback. See
   <iface>bank_before_read</iface>, <iface>bank_after_read</iface>,
   <iface>bank_before_write</iface>, and <iface>bank_after_write</iface> for
   details.
