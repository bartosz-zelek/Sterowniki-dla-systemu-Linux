  <add id="describe_registers_interface_t">

  This interface is used by the Simics debugger to get certain information from
  a processor.

  The <fun>first_child</fun> function returns the first description in the
  sequence of child descriptions of parent or NULL if parent has no
  children. Groups can have both registers and groups as children, registers
  can only have fields as children and fields cannot have any children. If
  parent is NULL, return the first description in the sequence of top-level
  descriptions.

  Use <fun>next_description</fun> to deallocate the previous description and
  return the next description in the sequence or NULL if there are no more
  descriptions in the current sequence.

  The <fun>free_description</fun> function is used to free the description
  without returning the next one in the sequence.

  The <fun>first_named_value</fun> function returns the first named value in
  the sequence of named values for parent or NULL if there are no named values
  for parent. Only fields and registers can have named values.

  Use <fun>next_named_value</fun> to deallocate the previous named value and
  return the next named value or NULL if there are no more named values in this
  sequence.

  Use <fun>free_named_value</fun> to free the named value without returning the
  next one in the sequence.

  The <fun>get</fun> and <fun>set</fun> functions are used to get and set the
  value of the register. To set the value pass in a bytes_t for the value. The
  value passed in must be long enough to contain the full value of the
  register. If the bytes_t is too long it will be truncated. To get the value
  pass in a buffer_t which is long enough to contain the register's value. The
  value is encoded in little endian byte order.
