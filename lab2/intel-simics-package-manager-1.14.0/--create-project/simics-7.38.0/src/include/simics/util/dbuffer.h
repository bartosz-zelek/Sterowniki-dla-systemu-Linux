   <doc-item name="DESCRIPTION">
   This type is used to store blocks of binary data.  It is optimized
   for fast adding and removing of data, and does fast copying between
   buffers using copy-on-write semantics.

   The type is not inherently thread safe, so each instance must have a single
   thread as owner, and only the owner can read or write from the instance,
   however ownership can be transferred to another thread. To share the data
   with other threads, the instance must first be cloned using
   <fun>dbuffer_clone</fun>.

   <note>This is a legacy data type. New code should use one of
   <tt>frags_t</tt>, <tt>bytes_t</tt> or <tt>buffer_t</tt>.</note>

 * The *_some versions of these functions take an 'actual_len'

 * actual number of valid bytes in the returned buffer is then written
 * to *actual_len, and is smaller if it would have had to copy data to
 * return a pointer to the whole region.  If NULL is passed for
 * 'actual_len', it will force the functions to return the full
 * region.
 *
 * The other functions always create a complete region, equivalent to
 * passing NULL in the 'actual_len' parameter.
 *
 * The *_all versions of these functions assume 0 for 'offset', and
 * buffer_len(dbuffer) for 'len'.
