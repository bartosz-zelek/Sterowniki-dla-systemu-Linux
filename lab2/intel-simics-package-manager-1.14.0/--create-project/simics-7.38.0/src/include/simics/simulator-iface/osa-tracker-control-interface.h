   <ndx>enable!osa_tracker_control interface method</ndx>
   <fun>enable</fun> and
   <ndx>disable!osa_tracker_control interface method</ndx>
   <fun>disable</fun> are called from the OS Awareness framework,
   for all trackers that have been set in the <attr>top_trackers</attr>
   attribute for the <obj>node_tree</obj> object, when OS Awareness is
   enabled or disabled, respectively.

   <ndx>clear_state!osa_tracker_control interface method</ndx>
   <fun>clear_state</fun> is called to clear the trackers state. The tracker
   should clear all its internal data and its data in the node tree when this
   is called.  This call can only occur while the tracker is disabled.

   <ndx>add_processor!osa_tracker_control interface method</ndx>
   <fun>add_processor</fun> and
   <ndx>remove_processor!osa_tracker_control interface method</ndx>
   <fun>remove_processor</fun> are called to add or remove a processor
   <arg>cpu</arg> to/from the tracker which the tracker should start/stop
   tracking. If the tracker is registered as a top level tracker these methods
   will be called by the OS Awareness framework for all processors available
   to the framework when it is enabled or disabled. If the tracker is a guest
   under a hypervisor the hypervisor should call these methods when a
   processor becomes available or unavailable to the guest.
   These functions should return true if a processor was successfully added or
   removed, otherwise the function should return false.
