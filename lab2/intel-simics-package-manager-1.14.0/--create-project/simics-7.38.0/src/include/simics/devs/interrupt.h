/* <add id="simple_interrupt_interface_t">

   A device calls <fun>interrupt()</fun> to logically raise an interrupt and
   <fun>interrupt_clear()</fun> to lower an interrupt.

   The first argument is the object to interrupt, usually a cpu. The
   integer argument to both functions may indicate an interrupt level
   or interrupt pin depending on the receiving device.

   On ARM the integer argument indicates whether the interrupt is normal or
   fast, by being either ARM_INT_IRQ or ARM_INT_FIQ defined by the ARM API
   (by including <file>&lt;simics/arch/arm.h&gt;</file>).

   This interrupt_query interface is used by devices connected to interrupt
   controllers to query whether their irq level is enabled in the interrupt
   controller or not. This is done by the is_enabled function.

   It can also be used to register a callback function to be called when the
   irq is enabled or disabled through the register_callback function.

   This is very old design, do not use in new models!
