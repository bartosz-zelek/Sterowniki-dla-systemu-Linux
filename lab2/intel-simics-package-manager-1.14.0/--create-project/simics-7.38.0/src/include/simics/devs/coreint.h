/* <add id="coreint_interface_t">
   Interface between CoreInt capable processor and interrupt controller.

   This interface is implemented by CoreInt capable interrupt controllers and
   allows the processor to automatically acknowledge external interrupts
   without software intervention.

   The <fun>acknowledge</fun> function is called by the processor when an
   external interrupt is taken. If coreint is enabled in the interrupt
   controller, the interrupt controller should lower the interrupt signal
   towards the processor and return the interrupt source
   vector. This way the software doesn't have to go and query the
   interrupt controller for the source. If coreint is not enabled, the
   interrupt should not do anything and the vector value in the reply is
   undefined.

   <add id="coreint_interface_exec_context">
