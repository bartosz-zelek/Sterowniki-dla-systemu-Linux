/* <add id="hpi_interface_t">
   This interface defines HPI, Host Port Interface, which can be 
   used by a host to access the DSP memory space. The access
   functions have been designed to resemble the HPI hardware interface.

   The interface consists of three read/write access functions;
   <fun>read/write_hpic()</fun> accesses the HPI controller 
   register. Typically the host uses <fun>write_hpic()</fun> 
   to clear the HINT bit (writing a one to the bit) when the
   interrupt has been serviced.

   The <fun>read/write_hpia()</fun> functions are used to read 
   or set the address to the memory location which should be later 
   read or written. Reading HPIA either returns HPIAR or HPIAW
   depending on if last access to HPID was a read or write.
   Setting HPIA sets both HPIAR and HPIAW.

   Finally, to access the memory the <fun>read/write_hpid()</fun>
   functions are used. These functions have a autoincrement flag
   allowing the HPIAR or HPIAW to automatically increment the
   value with 4 after the access is finished.

   All access functions assumes that the registers and data are
   represented in host endianness.
