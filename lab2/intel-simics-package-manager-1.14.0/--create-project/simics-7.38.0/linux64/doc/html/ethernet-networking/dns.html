The service node includes the functionality of a simple <i>Domain Name
Server</i> (DNS), that a simulated client can use to translate a
host/domain name into an IP address and vice versa. The DNS service is
based on the same host table as the DHCP service, and only answers
requests for A and PTR records.
</p><p>
For entries in the table that will only be used to answer DNS requests, and not
for DHCP, the MAC address can be left out.  <a name="DNSadd-host"></a>
The <b>&lt;service_node_comp&gt;.add-host</b> command can be used to add table
entries, and the <b>&lt;service_node_comp&gt;.list-host-info</b> command prints
the current table.  By default, all host entries will use
the <code>network.sim</code> domain.

For dynamic DHCP addresses, a DNS name will be added for the new IP number, so
that any of these addresses can be found by the DNS service. When connected to
a real network, the DNS service can do external lookups for names it does not
recognize.
