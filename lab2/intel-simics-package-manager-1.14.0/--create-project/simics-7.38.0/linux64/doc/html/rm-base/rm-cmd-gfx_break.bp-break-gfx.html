</h2>
 Set Simics to break simulation when the graphical breakpoint defined by <i>filename</i> matches.
<p>
A graphical breakpoint matches when its image appears on the screen, in the same location as when it was saved. The breakpoint must have been created using the Simics GUI or the command <code>save-break-xy</code>. The screen is checked for matches every <i>interval</i> seconds of virtual time on the clock associated to the console.
</p><p>
The <tt>-once</tt> flag causes the breakpoint to automatically be removed after it has triggered.
