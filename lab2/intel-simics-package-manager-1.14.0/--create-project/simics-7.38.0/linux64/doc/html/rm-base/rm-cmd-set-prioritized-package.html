</h2>
 Mark a Simics package, with the name <i>package</i>, as prioritized. When a module to be loaded is found in several packages, the one from a prioritized package takes precedence over the modules found in non-prioritized packages. This priority mechanism overrides the default behavior of selecting the most recently built module. Modules found in user-added search paths and in the project directory still have higher priority than modules from packages.
<p>
For scripts distributed in a package, the <tt>-current</tt> flag can be used instead of a name to mark the package they belong to as prioritized.
</p><p>
Using the <tt>-clear</tt> flag will empty the list of prioritized packages.
