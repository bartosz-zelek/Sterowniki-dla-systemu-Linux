</h2>
 Print a report based on collected object lock statistics. The report contains information about the number of times a lock has been taken and the average wait time for the lock to become available. The third column displays what kind of lock was taken where 'C' means cell, 'S' means serial domain, otherwise it means an object lock.
<p>
Uncontended locks are excluded from the statistics unless the <tt>-u</tt> flag is used, in which case the report is based solely on uncontended lock acquisition.
</p><p>
The <tt>-f</tt> and <tt>-s</tt> flags can be used to only include statistics from "fast" or "slow" locks, respectively. A lock acquiry is considered "fast" if the wait time is less than 10 us.
