 - <i>compression</i> is the compression used on the file (none, gz), default is a guess based on file name<br>
 - <i>object</i> is the simics object whose state will be recorded, the object must implement the <tt>save_state</tt> interface<br>
 - <i>steps</i> is the number of steps between each state recording, default is 1.<br>
 - <i>type</i> is the type of state saved in the file (for devices that provide several, the most complete state is saved by default).
