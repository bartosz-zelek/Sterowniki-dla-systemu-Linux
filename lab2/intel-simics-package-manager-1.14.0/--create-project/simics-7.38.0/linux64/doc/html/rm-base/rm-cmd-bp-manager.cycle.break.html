<a href="#description">Description</a>
</h2>
 Sets a breakpoint that will trigger when the processor's cycle counter has reached the <i>cycle</i> number of cycles from the time the command was issued. If <tt>-absolute</tt> is specified, the number of cycles is counted from the start of the simulation instead.
<p>
If no processor is specified, the currently selected frontend processor is used. If <i>object</i> is provided, then the breakpoint functionality is added on that object.
