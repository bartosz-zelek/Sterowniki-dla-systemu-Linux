<h1 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">1 Introduction</a></h1>
<p>This manual contains the reference documentation for Simics itself. It includes a complete list of all commands defined by the Simics core as well as by the loadable modules included in the main product. It also provides documentation on the available components and classes.</p>
<p>This manual is aimed at Simics users (the command list chapter, and possibly the lists of components and classes) and script developers (haps, classes, and interfaces).</p>
<p>This manual is strictly meant to be used as reference documentation, and it provides little explanation on how to use the various features described. Refer to other Simics manuals for more information; these are listed in the <em>Documentation Contents</em> document.<br>
