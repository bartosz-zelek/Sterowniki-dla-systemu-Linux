#:: doc info_status.check_for_info_status {{
# Check that the classes in a list of modules have info and status commands.
#
# Classes are Simics configuration classes, not python classes. The function
# checks all the classes in the named modules to see if they have `info` and
# `status` commands. If any such command is missing it will be detected as an
# error, but you can provide passlists. If a class is passlisted and still has
# the command it will be detected as an error. If any errors are detected the
# function calls a function to report this. By default the
# `report_info_status_error` is called, but you can override this with the
# `report_errors` argument.
#
# The modules named in modules will be loaded into Simics as a side effect of
# running this test.
