Create a new time server that listens on <arg>port</arg> (8123 by default), or
use <arg>port</arg> 0 for any port. <arg>name</arg> is optional and the name
of the created object will be returned.

With the <tt>-poll</tt> flag the time-server will periodically poll the time
and return the polled value in queries. Otherwise, the time server will always
return the current time in queries. Polled mode offers better performance when
the time server is queried at a high frequency, but does not support events.

Connected clients can query the virtual time, install alarm events
that are triggered after a certain amount of virtual time, or install
keepalive events that trigger at a periodic rate (real time).""")
