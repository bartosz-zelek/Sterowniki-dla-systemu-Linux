/*
 * IO-APIC interface.
 *
 * eoi() is called by the apic-bus when it receives an end-of-interrupt message
 * for a level-triggered interrupt. eoi() is called for all IO-APICs connected
 * to the apic-bus, regardless of the actual initiator. Vector is the interrupt
 * vector number between 16 and 255.
 *
 * interrupt() / interrupt_clear() are used by devices that want to generate an
 * interrupt towards the IO-APIC. The pin argument is the input pin number, a
 * value between 0 and 23. For edge-triggered interrupts, only interrupt()
 * should be called.
