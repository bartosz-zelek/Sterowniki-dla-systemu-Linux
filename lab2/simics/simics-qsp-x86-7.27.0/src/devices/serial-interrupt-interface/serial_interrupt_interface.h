/*::add interface to-section add-on-interfaces
short: interfaces for serial interrupt

The interfaces `serial_interrupt_master` and `serial_interrupt_slave` are
used to model serial interrupt communications between a serial interrupt
controller and a serial interrupt device. The controller implements
`serial_interrupt_master` and the device implements `serial_interrupt_slave`.

The device calls `start_request` in the controller to request serial
interrupt transfer cycles start frame.

The controller calls `start` to start the serial interrupt communications,
detects interrupt states one by one by calling `fetch`, and
finishes the serial interrupt sequence by `stop`.

The returned value of `fetch` is the level of the current data frame.
It is either 0 (low) or 1 (high).

The `mode` is used to specifies the SERIRQ transfer cycles mode.
It is 1 for *Quiet* and 0 for *Continuous* mode.

## Execution Context

Cell Context for all methods.
