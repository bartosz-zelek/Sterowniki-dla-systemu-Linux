<h1 id="multiple-software-domains"><a href="#multiple-software-domains">2.10 Multiple Software Domains</a></h1>
<p>A software domain is a system or subsystem where target software runs. All software tracking mechanisms described in this chapter work individually in each software domain without affecting each other. If a configuration contains two hardware subsystems that run different software instances, there will be two separate software trackers, each one tracking the software in one of the two subsystems.</p>
<p>For most configurations, an <code>os_awareness</code> object that defines the software domain will be placed in each top-level system object, in its <code>software</code> slot. For some complex configurations it is possible to define software domains differently by placing the <code>os_awareness</code> object elsewhere in the object hierarchy, or by configuring it to use a subset of the available processors.</p>
<p>See the <em>Model Builder User's Guide</em> for more information about software domains.</p>
