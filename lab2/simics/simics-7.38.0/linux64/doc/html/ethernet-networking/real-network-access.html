<p>

</p><p>
When connecting to a real network using other connection types than
port forwarding, Simics needs low-level access to the simulation
host's Ethernet interfaces to send and receive packets. However,
operating systems do not usually allow user programs low-level access
to Ethernet interfaces: it requires specific configuration with
administrative rights.
</p><p>
The access method used by Simics is called <em><a name="TAP">TAP</a></em>; it
is a virtual Ethernet interface on the simulation host. Ethernet
bridging and host connections require the use of TAP, but, as stated
above, port forwarding connections do not.
