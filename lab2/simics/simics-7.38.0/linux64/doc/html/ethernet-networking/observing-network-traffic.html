Simics proposes several ways of listening to the network traffic on one, or all
Ethernet links. Simics includes ready-to-use traffic dumping capabilities,
using external network monitoring tools. It also provides an Ethernet probe and
Ethernet snooper capabilities, giving access to a programmatic interface for
listening to the network traffic.
