</h2>
 Verify that the cell partitioning into cells of the given <i>checkpoint</i> is correct; that is, that no objects in one cell have references to objects in another cell.
<p>
If no checkpoint is given, check the currently loaded configuration.
</p><p>
Objects having a boolean attribute <b>outside_cell</b> that is set to True are not considered part of any cell and are thus exempted from the check.
</p><p>
When used in an expression, command returns True if no errors were found. False is returned if any errors were found.
