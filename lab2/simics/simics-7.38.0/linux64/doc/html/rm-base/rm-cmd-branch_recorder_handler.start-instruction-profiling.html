</h2>
 This command gets you started with instruction profiling quickly by creating a branch recorder for you and attaching it to the processor. If you want more control, use other profiling commands instead.
<p>
It creates a branch recorder and attaches it to the processor, just as if you had typed
</p><p>
<tt>new-branch-recorder</tt> <i>branch_recorder</i> <tt>physical</tt>
</p><p>
<i>cpu</i><tt>.attach-branch-recorder</tt> <i>branch_recorder</i>
</p><p>
The branch recorder will (as the name implies) record branches taken by the processor (by physical addresses); various useful numbers can be computed from them. You can for example display execution count statistics by typing
</p><p>
<i>branch_recorder</i><tt>.address-profile-data</tt>
</p><p>
(but you will not see anything interesting until you have let the processor run a few instructions).
</p><p>
With the <tt>-virtual</tt> flag, record virtual addresses; otherwise, record physical addresses.
