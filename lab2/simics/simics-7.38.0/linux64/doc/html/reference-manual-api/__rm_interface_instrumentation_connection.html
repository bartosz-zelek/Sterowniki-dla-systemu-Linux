<dt class="jdocu_descitem">Description</dt><dd class="jdocu_descitem">This interface is intended to be implemented by instrumentation connections
   using the instrumentation framework. This interface is used to request that
   instrumentation should be temporarily disabled and then re-enabled. That is,
   the connection should not collect any data when it is being disabled. How
   this is achieved is up to the tool, it could tell the provider to stop
   sending information, or simply throw away anything it sends.
   This interface can be used with high frequency while simulation is running,
   so it should be implemented with performance in mind.
