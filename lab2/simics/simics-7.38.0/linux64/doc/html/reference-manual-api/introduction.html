This manual contains the reference documentation for most Simics
APIs. It describes the Device API, as well as the interfaces and haps
that are available for developing models. The manual also describes
the Simulator API and its interfaces, for use when developing
extensions to Simics. Furthermore, the manual details the Link Library
API - that's used to create link models to connect devices in
different cells. The Processor API is used to create models of
processors for use in Simics; the reference documentation for the
Processor API is also present in this manual. The manual is concluded
with the reference documentation of the Python API.
</p><p>
This manual is primarily meant to be used as reference documentation, but it
also describes some concepts of central importance closely related
to the API. Refer to the other Simics manuals, listed in the
<em>Documentation Contents</em> document, for more details
about other things.
