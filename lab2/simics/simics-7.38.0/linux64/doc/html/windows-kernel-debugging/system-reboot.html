<p>
  
</p><p>
  These changes do not take effect until the target system is rebooted. To make
  it easy to get into debug:
</p><p>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Shutdown the target system,</li>
    <li>When the shutdown is complete (it is not given that Simics stops at
      this point, since power-off is an allowed operation in a virtual
      platform), stop Simics.</li>
    <li>Save the complete disk state to use this as your base disk, or save a
      diff to apply in the reboot.</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  For the <i>QSP-x86</i> system, a complete image save is done in
  a way like this:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>board.disk0.hd_image.save -save-craff win10-debug.craff</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
  Start a new Simics session using this new disk image as the boot image.
