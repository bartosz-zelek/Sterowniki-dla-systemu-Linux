<b>Note:</b>
This chapter uses <i>QSP-x86</i> model as an example target
    platform model. Some of the instructions will need to be adjusted to the
    particular target model where it differs from <i>QSP-x86</i>
    model.
<p>
    In order to be able to adapt <i>QSP-x86</i> examples to the
    particular target model familiarity with target model and general Simics
    environment is required.
  </p></div>Windows kernel debugging configuration in Simics could be created in
  such a way, that Windows debugger client connects to the target kernel
  debugger via a real network. More specifically, Windows kernel running
  on Simics target systems communicates with Windows kernel debugger
  running on real host over a real network connection (figure
  <a class="reference" href="#windbg-network-setup">1</a>). For more detailed information
  about setting the newtwork connection up please refer to "Windows
  Kernel Debugging Over a Network" (section
  <a class="reference" href="network-debugging.html">2</a>).
