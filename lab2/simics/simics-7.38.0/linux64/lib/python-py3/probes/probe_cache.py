# Decorator for cached access of a probe. The method which used this
# decorator, should only have a 'self' as an argument.
#
# With caching enabled, probes can return the previous value back,
# avoiding expensive calculation, if they are read multiple times
# (either directly or indirectly from other probes). It can also be
# used to avoid probe values to return a slightly different value the
# next time in the same sample, such as wallclock time.
#
# The samplers are responsible for enabling caching when taking
# a sample. Using the probe_sampler_cache->enable() method.
# This increments a generation id specific for this cached session.
#
# As long as the object has a cached value from the same generation
# id, this cached value can be returned.
#
# When sampling is finished the probe_sampler_cache->disable()
# will be called, causing the "not-cached" generation id of zero
# to be returned.
#
# If several probes should share the same cache, the method needs
# to be put on a class with a singleton object, which is used to
# share the probe value.
