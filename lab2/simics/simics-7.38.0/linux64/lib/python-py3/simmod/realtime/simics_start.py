In some cases simulated time may run faster than real time; this can
happen if the OS is in a tight idle loop or an instruction halts
execution waiting for an interrupt, or if the host machine is simply
sufficiently fast. This can cause problems for programs that interact
with the real world (for example the user), since time-outs may expire
really fast.

A <obj>realtime</obj> object will, when enabled, periodically check
the simulation speed and wait for a while if it is too high.
<arg>speed</arg> specifies how fast simulated time is allowed to run,
in percent of real time; default is 100. <arg>check_interval</arg>
specifies how often the check should take place, in milliseconds of
simulated time; default is 1000. Higher values give better
performance; lower values reduce the maximum difference between real
and simulated time. Setting this to less than
<cmd>set-time-quantum</cmd> has no effect.

The <arg>speed</arg> argument says how fast the simulation
<em>should</em> run, but the actual speed will always deviate a little
from that value even if the host is fast enough. To keep these errors
from accumulating, the simulation speed has to be adjusted;
<arg>drift-compensate</arg> regulates how much it may be adjusted. If
set to (for example) 0.25, simulation speed may be increased or
decreased by up to 25% if necessary to make up for any accumulated
drift with respect to real time. If set to zero (the default), the
simulation speed may not be changed at all from its set value.

The <arg>clock</arg> will control which clock is used for real-time
comparison. A configuration may have many clocks/processors. Virtual
time is based on a Simics clock and by default the first clock found
is used to control real-time mode. However, some use cases may allow
clocks to drift apart significantly, which may affect real-time
mode. In such a case, it may be useful to use the <arg>clock</arg>
argument. Notice that the clock can not be changed after the real-time
command has been invoked.

Control this feature by the <cmd>enable-real-time-mode</cmd> and
<cmd>disable-real-time-mode</cmd> commands. The <cmd>real-time-mode</cmd>
command will query whether real-time is enabled or not.

It is possible to run the <cmd>enable-real-time-mode</cmd> command before any
cycle object exists in the configuration. In this case creation of the
<obj>realtime</obj> object will be postponed until a cycle object has been
created. Run <cmd>disable-real-time-mode</cmd> to inhibit postponed mode.
