    Create an object used to launch VTune and connect
    it to the Simics session for performance profiling of Simics itself.

    The <arg>name</arg> argument can be used to select the name of the
    Simics object created. The <arg>vtune-path</arg> argument specifies
    where VTune Profiler is installed, if not specified, it must either
    have been setup earlier, followed by a <cmd>save-preferences</cmd>
    command, or it must be in the standard path.

    Once the object is created, <cmd
    class="vtune_measurement">start</cmd> command can be used to start
    performance measurement using VTune's "hotspots" analyses.  Run
    the simulation that should be measured and issue the <cmd
    class="vtune_measurement">stop</cmd> when finished.

    After stopping the measurement, the <cmd
    class="vtune_measurement">summary</cmd>, <cmd
    class="vtune_measurement">module-profile</cmd> and <cmd
    class="vtune_measurement">profile</cmd> commands can be used to
    see the hotspots. The VTune result is also stored in a directory
    which can used to analyze the result more in depth using the
    <tt>vtune-gui</tt>.""")
