Create an HTML code coverage report, with the root directory specified by the

will be displayed as the title and header in the HTML pages.

If the <tt>-no-disassembly</tt> flag is set, no disassembly will be included in
the HTML report.

If the <tt>-no-unmapped-addresses</tt> flag is set, addresses that has been
run, but was not mapped into a known memory map of any symbol file will be
ignored. This can typically be addresses that are part of interrupt routines,
padding instructions between functions, or addresses for which there where no
mapping found, although there should have been.

If the <tt>-no-unknown-modules</tt> flag is set, modules that has no debug
information mapping of any kind associated with them, will not show up in the
report.

If the <tt>-no-summary-table</tt> flag is set, the function coverage summary
for the disassembly report will be disabled.

If the <tt>-no-module-line-coverage</tt> flag is set, source line coverage
per symbol file and function will be excluded from disassembly reports.

If the <tt>-no-function-coverage</tt> flag is set, the function coverage report
page is excluded.

If the <tt>-only-addresses-with-source</tt> flag is set, instructions that are
not associated with any source line will be excluded from the disassembly
report.

If the <tt>-only-disassembly</tt> flag is set, no source code coverage
will be reported, only the disassembly coverage.

If the <tt>-include-opcode</tt> flag is set opcode will be shown in
the disassembly coverage report.

If the <tt>-include-line</tt> flag is set line numbers will be shown in
the disassembly coverage report.

The <tt>-summary-per-file</tt> flag specifies that the source coverage page
should include every file on that page, otherwise the main page will group
coverage per directory.

The <tt>-tree-summary</tt> flag specifies that the summary page should be
presented in such a way that covered lines and percentage include coverage for
all sub-directories as well.

The <tt>-show-line-functions</tt> flag can be used to output which functions
make use of each line, in the source file reports. This can be useful to gain a
better understanding of why source lines are covered or not when there are
optimizations and inlined code involved.

The <tt>-no-data-labels</tt> flag will tell the command to <b>not</b> try to
handle certain function names as data labels and instead keep them as
functions. This will lead to that these labels as included in the disassembly
report as functions, even though they are most likely data. Without this options
data ranges following such labels will be excluded from the report. Altering
this flag implies removing old data.

The <tt>-source-only-data</tt> flag will force the source code data to be
collected in the way the <cmd class="code_coverage">add-source-only-info</cmd>
command does it, regardless of architecture. This implies the
<tt>-no-disassembly</tt> flag. Previously added source and disassembly
information of other format will be removed from the raw report data.

The <arg>source-files-base-path</arg> option can be used to override the default
base path on the source files summary page. Setting this to "" will result in
full paths being displayed for all paths.

The <arg>max-errors-per-mapping</arg> argument can be used to specify a
maximum number of errors to show per mapping. If this is set to a negative
value an unlimited amout of errors will be shown.

If the data collection done by the <cmd
class="code_coverage">add-functions</cmd>, and <cmd
class="code_coverage">disassemble</cmd>, <cmd

this will be done before saving the report.
