    The <class>agent_handle</class> class is used by <i>Matic</i> to resemble
    connections with Simics Agents, which are running on target systems. A
    handle provides the user with commands so that she can interact with the
    agent of the handle.

    An agent handle can only be connected to one Simics Agent but an agent may
    be connected to several handles.

    Matic requires the simulation to run, allowing Simics Agents on the

    &lt;agent_manager&gt;.connect-to-agent</nref></cmd> command creates an
    agent handle that will be associated with an agent as soon as possible.
    Agent handles should be deleted when they no longer are needed.

    The <attr>stale_timeout</attr> attribute controls the timeout period after
    the end of an agent poll interval until the Simics Agent is declared dead
    unless it has made contact. The setting applies individually to each Simics
    Agent, but control is shared among its handles. Once dead, all its handles
    will become stale and all their commands will be canceled. New commands
    cannot be given to a stale handle.

    Agent that is running on a target machine. If an agent is not found or the
    simulation is not running, the agent_handle object is immediately returned
    and ready to accept commands; the connection is finished eventually.

    The <arg>name</arg> must be unique. If not given it defaults to
    'matic<i>N</i>', where '<i>N</i>' is an integer.

    The <arg>identifier</arg> is a string that is used to filter for an
    agent. The first agent that matches the argument will be selected. If no
    agent is found, an agent_handle object is immediately returned and the
    command will finish when a match is found, if ever. Without argument,
    the first found agent is selected.

    An identifier may take any of three forms and it is matched in this order:

    The identifier may be an <b>agent-id</b> on the form 'agent-name<i>N</i>',
    where '<i>N</i>' is an integer. An underscore is inserted before <i>N</i> if
    the agent name ends with a digit. The 'agent-id' is generated by the agent
    manager when a new agent is found. This is the only unique identifier.

    The identifier may be the <b>agent-name</b> with which the Simics Agent
    announces itself. By default that is the host name of the target system,
    but it can also be given as a command line argument when starting the
    Simics Agent on the target system.

    The identifier may be any part of a <b>hierarchical name</b> that
    identifies where in the configuration the Simics Agent is running. For
    example, 'cpu0' may work, or maybe the longer 'viper0.mb.cpu0' is
    needed. Avoid being too specific about the processor core, since the
    operating system of the target system may schedule the agent
    differently.
