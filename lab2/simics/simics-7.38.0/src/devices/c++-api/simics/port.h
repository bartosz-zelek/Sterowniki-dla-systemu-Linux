/**
 * @brief Extends ConfObject to add utilities to a Simics port object
 * 
 * A class inherited the ConfObject class can be registered as a port object.
 * A port object is a child object of a parent object, which is created
 * automatically together with its parent object. This class provides utilities
 * to access the parent object and the index of the port object array.
 *
 * @tparam TParent The parent class of the port object
 * TParent is the template class typename for Port, typically representing the
 * C++ class of the port's parent. A complete definition of TParent is
 * necessary, so it is advisable to define the port class after the TParent
 * class or as an inner class within TParent to ensure proper access to its
 * private members. If the port class does not need to access the parent's
 * class members, you can use ConfObject as TParent to eliminate dependencies
 * on the parent C++ class. Or simply use ConfObject as the parent class.
