/* <add id="magic_pipe_setup_interface_t"> The magic pipe setup interface is
  used to establish connections between an application running in the simulated
  target system and a Simics extension executing on the simulator host.

  Magic numbers are used to identify and isolate connections, called
  pipes. Typically a well-known value is used to perform a handshake and then
  assign a new and unique value, which is used in all successive correspondence
  between the end-points.

  The Simics extension is responsible for assigning these new and unique magic
  numbers, and to subscribe to them. This interface provides the necessary
  facilities to either get a new random number or reserve a range for the
  service to distribute on its own.

  An example of a common communication flow can be divided into two phases,
  first the initial handshake phase where some information about each other is
  exchanged, followed by the duty phase where the target system application is
  communicating back and forth with the host system Simics extension to fulfill
  their purpose.

  The handshake is initiated from the target application, which sends a
  handshake request to the host system extension containing some information
  about itself. The host system extension receives the request and replies with
  a new magic number and some information about itself. The new magic number is
  to be used in all further communication between the parties, to isolate the
  communications pipe from other users of the magic pipe.

  In the duty phase the common communication flow may look like this. The
  target system application starts by allocating a pipe buffer from the magic
  pipe library. Then writes its data to the buffer and sends it to the host
  system extension. The extension handles the data and reuses the same buffer
  to write something back to the application. This means that the buffer size
  is fixed and limits the amount of data that can be returned. Because of this
  it is common for the application to allocate more space than needed for its
  sent data. Once the application returns from its send call, the same buffer
  it allocated earlier is filled with data coming from the extension. This data
  is handled by the application and then the buffer is freed. This duty cycle
  is then repeated as many times as needed.

  Each magic number may have more than one subscribers, therefore reading and
  writing is divided into two phases, where all readers are allowed access
  first. Then comes the writer phase and the subscribers are called in the
  order they registered. This also means that later writer subscribers are
  limited to writing only the remaining amount of data to the buffer.

  There is no on or off setting for a pipe to enable or disable the
  communication. The only option is to unregister from the magic number to
  suspend the communication and then to register again to resume.

  The registered subscribers should unregister when they are no longer
  interested in receiving any data. This will also allow the magic pipe to stop
  listening to haps when there is no one to receive them. The magic pipe will
  automatically resume listening once there are subscribers again.

    <note>This interface is an experimental feature. It is excluded from the
  standard support program, and is subject to change or removal without
  notice.</note>
