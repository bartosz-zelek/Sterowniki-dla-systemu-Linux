/* <add id="x86_tsc_cycles">
    The interface is used to convert CPU time stamp counter values to CPU cycles
    and back. It is primarily intended for systems that use ART (always running
    timer), which have values reported by RDTSC scaled relative to actual
    processor clocks. See description of numerator and denominator values of
    CPUID leaf 0x15 in the Intel SDM.

    The <b>tsc_to_cycles</b> method is used to convert interval <b>tsc</b>
    measured in TSC time units to processor cycles.
    The <b>tsc_from_cycles</b> method is meant to convert interval <b>cycles</b>
    measured in processor cycle time units to value would have been returned by
    RDTSC.

    For systems that do not use ART, both methods may return input unchanged,
    thus yielding ratio 1:1.
