When enabled, a <obj>realtime</obj> object will periodically check the
simulation speed and wait for a while if it is too high.

<arg>speed</arg> specifies how fast simulated time is allowed to run, in
percent of real time; default is 100.

<arg>check-interval</arg> specifies how often the check should take place, in
milliseconds of simulated time; default is 1000. Higher values give better
performance; lower values reduce the maximum difference between real and
simulated time. Setting this to less than <cmd>set-time-quantum</cmd> has no
effect.

Upon deviation, <arg>drift-compensate</arg> regulates how much may be
adjusted. If set to (for example) 0.25, simulation speed may be increased or
decreased by up to 25% if necessary to make up for any accumulated drift with
respect to real time. If set to zero (the default), the simulation speed may
not be changed at all from its set value.
