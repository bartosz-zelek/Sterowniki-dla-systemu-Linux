/* <add id="io_memory_interface_t">

   This interface is implemented by devices that can be mapped into address
   spaces (including port spaces). The <fun>operation()</fun> is called when
   the object is accessed through an address space.

   The <arg>obj</arg> argument is a pointer to the mapped object and
   <arg>map_info</arg> contains information about how and where
   the device is mapped into memory. The <arg>mem_op</arg> argument
   to <fun>operation()</fun> contains information about the access.

   The offset into the device mapping for the access is typically
   calculated in the following way:

   <small>
   <tt>offset = SIM_get_mem_op_physical_address(mem_op)
   - map_info.base + map_info.start</tt>
   </small>

   <note>The <fun>map()</fun> function is deprecated and should not be
   used. The function may be called when the object is mapped into an address
   space, but it is not guaranteed that this happens. The function can be left
   unimplemented (NULL).</note>

   The <type>exception_type_t</type> type, returned by the
   <fun>operation()</fun> function may be used to signal errors to
   Simics, but should in most cases be <tt>Sim_PE_No_Exception</tt>.
   If the device does not support inquiry accesses, it should return
   <tt>Sim_PE_Inquiry_Unhandled</tt> if <tt>mem_op->inquiry</tt> is 1.

   <note>This interface is legacy. New code should use the
   <iface>transaction</iface> interface.</note>
