/* <add id="nand_flash_interface_t">

   The <iface>nand_flash</iface> interface is used to perform read and write
   accesses and control some pins on NAND Flash devices.

   The <fun>read_access()</fun> and <fun>write_access()</fun> functions perform
   read and write accesses.

   The <fun>set_command_latch_enable()</fun>,
   <fun>set_address_latch_enable()</fun>, <fun>set_write_protect()</fun> and
   <fun>set_spare_area_enable()</fun> functions set the input level of the pins
   with the same names. 0 represents low input and 1 represents high input.

   The chip enable and ready/busy pins are not modelled. The NAND Flash device
   assumes that chip enable is always asserted, and the device is never busy.
