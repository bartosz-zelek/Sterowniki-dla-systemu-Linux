   This interface is implemented by SATA objects that provide
   an interface for serial data delivery.

   This interface can be used in both direction in SATA communication.
   The <fun>receive_fis</fun> function is used by a device to send 
   a SATA FIS to the SATA controller(HBA). The same function is used
   when sending a SATA FIS from HBA to SATA device. The FIS should be
   a <type><idx>bytes_t</idx></type> containing a complete SATA FIS.
   Different types of FIS may have different length. Please follow
   SATA specification when determine the length and content of the FIS.
