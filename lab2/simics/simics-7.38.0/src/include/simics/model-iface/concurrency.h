   The <iface>concurrency_mode</iface> interface allows a model to
   support a concurrency mode other than the default
   <const>Sim_Concurrency_Mode_Serialized</const>.

   The <fun>supported_modes</fun> method returns a bitmask
   with all the supported modes.

   The <fun>current_mode</fun> method returns the currently active
   mode. Note that the model should normally checkpoint this setting.

   The <fun>switch_mode</fun> method is invoked by Simics to notify
   a model that a different concurrency mode has been selected by the user.
   This typically happens when the user switches threading mode using
   the <cmd>set-threading-mode</cmd> command. The object will typically
   be placed in a different thread domain shortly after the call to this
   method.

   A model will be placed in the cell thread domain if it uses
   the <const>Sim_Concurrency_Mode_Serialized</const> mode and
   in a separate thread domain otherwise. The <iface>concurrency_group</iface>
   interface can be used to ensure that multiple objects are placed in the
   same thread domain.

   Refer to the chapter about threading in the
   <cite>API Reference Manual</cite> for details about thread domains,
   the Standard Device Model and the Threaded Device Model.

   <add id="concurrency_group_interface_t">

   The <iface>concurrency_group</iface> interface is used to ensure
   that groups of objects are placed in the same thread domain.

   The <fun>serialized_memory_group</fun> method returns a list with objects
   that should be placed in the same thread domain when the models
   run in <const>Sim_Concurrency_Mode_Serialized_Memory</const>.

   The <fun>execution_group</fun> method returns a list with objects that
   should always be placed in the same thread domain.

   Both methods take a <arg>group_index</arg> argument, allowing
   multiple lists to be returned. The index argument is 0-based,
   and a nil attribute for the first unsupported index. Note that
   returned lists do not necessarily contain the object implementing
   the interface; the interface can be used to group other objects.

   When Simics forms the thread domain groups, all objects implementing the
   <iface>concurrency_group</iface> are queried, and the constraints
   are combined. For instance, the groups [A, B] and [A, C]
   are combined into the group [A, B, C]. That is, the objects
   A, B and C will be put in the same thread domain.

   Refer to the threading chapter in the <cite>API Reference Manual</cite>
   for more details.
