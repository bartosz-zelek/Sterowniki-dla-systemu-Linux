   Deprecated interface. Use global notifiers and/or attributes instead.

   This interface was used to save micro checkpoints for reverse execution.
   It remains in 7, but is only used to get notifications when an
   object's state is about to be restored, or has just been restored.

   All functions in this interface are optional.
   
   The <fun>save</fun> and <fun>merge</fun> functions are never called.

   The function <fun>prepare_restore</fun> is called when a saved state
   is about to be loaded, before any attributes have been set.

   The <fun>finish_restore</fun> function is called when all
   attributes have been set. The <arg>state</arg> argument is
   always NULL.
