   The <iface>transaction</iface> interface is implemented by devices that
   can be mapped into address spaces. The <fun>issue</fun> method is called
   when a memory transaction <arg>t</arg> is issued to the object.

   The return value of the <fun>issue</fun> function is normally
   <tt>Sim_PE_No_Exception</tt>, but other pseudo <type>exception_type_t</type>
   values can be used to signal error conditions. The value
   <tt>Sim_PE_Deferred</tt> must be used when the transaction has been
   deferred using <fun>SIM_defer_transaction</fun> for completion at
   some later time.
