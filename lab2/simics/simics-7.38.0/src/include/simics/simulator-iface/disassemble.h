   The disassemble interface can be used to disassemble code from a

   host architecture independent of the target architecture
   implemented in a particular version of Simics.

   <insert-until text="// ADD INTERFACE disassemble_interface"/>

   <fun>init()</fun> is used to initialize a new disassemble
   session. You should provide a buffer in <tt>buff</tt>, the buffer
   length in bytes in <tt>buff_len</tt> and the base address for this
   chunk in <tt>address</tt>. The <tt>address</tt> parameter is used
   to calculate program counter relative offsets (for branches and
   other program counter relative constructs).

   <fun>next()</fun> returns a structure with the next disassembled

   additional instructions.
