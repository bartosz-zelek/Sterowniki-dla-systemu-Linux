/* <add id="register_breakpoint_interface_t"> This is an optional CPU interface
   allowing the execution to break upon any register change, both explicit by
   the software and implicit changes by the model itself.

   The <fun>add_breakpoint</fun> function adds a new breakpoint. The
   <arg>reg_name</arg> is the register name. When register becomes the
   <arg>value</arg>, simulator will stop. The <arg>break_upon_change</arg>
   means whether simulator should stop upon change of the register value. In
   this case, <arg>value</arg> is not used. The <arg>mask</arg> can be used
   when only certain bits are of interest.

   The <fun>remove_breakpoint</fun> function removes a breakpoint with a given
   id. If the id is -1, then all breakpoints are removed.

   The function <fun>get_breakpoints</fun> returns a list of defined
   breakpoints. Each breakpoint in the list is described by a tuple:
   (breakpoint_id, register_name, break_value, mask). If the breakpoint is
   triggered upon every register value change, then break_value is NIL.
