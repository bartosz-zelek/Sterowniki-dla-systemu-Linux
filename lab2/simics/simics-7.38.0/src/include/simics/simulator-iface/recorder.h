/* <add id="recorder_v2_interface_t">
   The <iface>recorder_v2</iface> interface is implemented by the recorder, and
   can be used by any object interacting with the outside world in order to
   make re-runs of the same simulation behave identically. This is a
   requirement for reverse execution to work. Objects using this interface must
   implement the <iface>recorded</iface> interface themselves.

   An object uses it by calling the <fun>record</fun> method with itself and
   the data it wishes to record as parameters. The recorder will then save
   the data and call the <fun>input</fun> method in the <iface>recorded</iface>
   interface on the object.

   The <fun>playback</fun> method returns whether the recorder is currently
   playing back recorded data. It may be used by the object to determine if
   output to the outside world should be dropped or not.
